              <p>
                When we started hearing about changes to Skype and exploring
                alternatives, we realized something important: finding the right
                communication tool isn't one-size-fits-all. Some of us needed
                crystal-clear business calls, others prioritized messaging
                features, and some just wanted the most affordable international
                rates.
              </p>
              <p>
                The search for alternatives led us down a rabbit hole of
                research, trials, and comparisons. After countless hours testing
                different platforms and comparing features, we thought: "Why
                keep this knowledge to ourselves?"
