These features ensure that [Discord](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/discord) remains a dependable choice for uninterrupted and secure video communication.

## 5. [TextNow](https://www.textnow.com/)

TextNow takes a different approach compared to video-focused platforms, centering on affordable voice and text services. If your priority is low-cost communication rather than high-quality video, this platform offers a budget-friendly option. Originally created as an economical phone service, TextNow provides **free calling and texting over Wi-Fi** to any number within the U.S. and Canada, along with competitively priced international calling options.

### Device Compatibility

TextNow no longer supports video calling. For voice and text services, your device needs to meet certain requirements. The TextNow SIM card is compatible with smartphones running **Android 8 or higher** or **iOS 15 or higher**. Additionally, your phone must be unlocked to activate the SIM card. To ensure smooth performance, the company advises keeping the TextNow app updated through the Google Play Store or the App Store.

### Video and Audio Quality

The quality of audio on TextNow varies depending on your connection. On the free plan, audio performance depends on the strength of your Wi-Fi or cellular data, which can lead to inconsistencies. However, users on the paid plan enjoy calls routed through a dedicated **Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)** network, which helps improve sound clarity. Even so, some users report issues like dropped audio, often linked to network coverage.

### Reliability

While TextNow provides unlimited calls and texts within the U.S. and Canada at minimal cost, reliability can be a concern. Dropped calls and inconsistent audio are common complaints. The platform's reliance on ads may also interrupt the user experience. Additionally, since TextNow is primarily designed for 4G and Wi-Fi networks, it doesn't take full advantage of the faster speeds and improved stability offered by 5G. Many users find it more suitable for casual texting than for critical voice communication.

In short, TextNow is best suited for basic communication needs rather than as a primary solution for video or high-quality voice calls. Its affordability makes it a great secondary option, but its limitations - like the lack of video calling and variable audio quality - may make it less reliable for more demanding uses.
