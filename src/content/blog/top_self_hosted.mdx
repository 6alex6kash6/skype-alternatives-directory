This ensures that your data remains private and intact, even if the servers are compromised. The platform's encryption methods lean on the weak collision-resistance of SHA256 and the secure Go implementation of the NaCl cryptographic library.

> "You don't need to trust Keybase. You only need to trust math."
> – Chris Dixon, in his announcement of a $10.8 million investment in Keybase

Keybase also uses public Merkle trees to manage keypairs, public identities, and file system states. This system ensures that Keybase has no access to private file names or contents, as all data is encrypted before being stored - even in local device journals. This encryption-first approach forms the backbone of its security.

### Open-source transparency

While Keybase offers a fully open-source client, its reliance on proprietary server components raises some transparency concerns. To address trust issues, Keybase uses Key Transparency (KT), a publicly auditable system for distributing sensitive cryptographic data like public keys. Additionally, the client software is designed to verify the integrity of user signature chains, alerting users to any potential tampering or rollbacks.
