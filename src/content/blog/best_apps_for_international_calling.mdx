## Best VoIP App for International Calls in 2023 - Call anywhere in the world for free!

## 1. Skype Alternatives

With Skype set to retire in 2025, it's a good time to explore other international calling options. These alternatives are reshaping the way we communicate globally, offering competitive advantages in cost, call quality, and coverage. As a sign of the times, 70% of businesses have already integrated VoIP solutions into their communication strategies. Below is a quick breakdown of key factors - cost, call quality, geographic coverage, and platform compatibility - that will be explored in greater depth later.

### Cost

Many of these platforms offer pricing structures designed to slash international calling expenses. Free app-to-app calls are standard, while paid options for landlines and mobile numbers boast rates as low as $0.01 per minute for popular locations. For businesses or heavy users, unlimited plans typically range between $10 and $26 per month, depending on the level of coverage required. Let's move on to how these services stack up in terms of call quality.

### Call Quality

Call quality can vary, but many of these platforms deliver excellent performance thanks to modern technology. For instance, Viber Out is often praised for its crystal-clear audio. Rebtel takes a unique approach by combining internet connectivity with local numbers to improve call stability. This strong performance in call quality pairs well with their affordable pricing, but coverage is another critical factor to consider.

### Geographic Coverage

These services provide extensive international coverage, offering competitive rates to key regions such as Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Apps like WhatsApp are particularly effective, as they work anywhere with internet access, making them ideal for areas with high smartphone usage. Coverage options range from unlimited plans for 50 countries to nearly global availability through internet-based solutions.

### Platform Compatibility

One of the standout features of these alternatives is their ability to work across multiple platforms. WhatsApp, for example, is compatible with iPhone, Android, Windows, and Mac. Viber offers similar flexibility, supporting iPhone, Android, Windows, and Mac as well. Google Voice also provides robust platform support. Many of these services even include web-based access, making them accessible on virtually any device.

## 2. WhatsApp

<SoftwareCard slug="whatsapp" />

[WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) is one of the most widely used options for international calling, boasting nearly 2 billion users globally. Chances are, many of your international contacts are already on the platform, making it incredibly convenient for staying connected.

### Cost

When it comes to cost, WhatsApp is hard to beat. Calls between WhatsApp users are completely free. As Tech.co's business phone expert Conor Cawley puts it:

> "WhatsApp is absolutely, 100% free of charge for personal use."

The only expense you might incur is data usage. On average, voice calls use between 0.15 and 0.5 MB of data per minute, while video calls consume around 3 to 5 MB per minute. For businesses, WhatsApp charges based on the type of conversation, with rates varying accordingly. Beyond cost, it's worth evaluating how the platform performs under different network conditions.

### Call Quality

WhatsApp ensures dependable call quality by leveraging adaptive VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology. This system adjusts to your available bandwidth, maintaining clear audio and video even under less-than-ideal conditions. A stable internet connection with a minimum speed of 128 kbps is recommended for optimal performance. The app works seamlessly on 3G, 4G, and 5G networks, and it compresses data packets to keep calls going even when the connection weakens. If your network struggles, WhatsApp prioritizes the call by reducing video quality rather than disconnecting entirely.

### Geographic Coverage

WhatsApp operates in over 180 countries, making it one of the most far-reaching platforms for international communication. However, some regions impose restrictions:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Country", "Restriction Type"],
    rows: [
      ["China", "Fully banned since 2017 due to end-to-end encryption"],
      ["North Korea", "Fully banned"],
      ["Syria", "Fully banned"],
      ["Iran", "Fully banned"],
      ["Qatar", "Voice and video calls restricted"],
      ["UAE", "Voice and video calls restricted"],
      ["Saudi Arabia", "Voice and video calls restricted"],
      ["Egypt", "Voice and video calls restricted"],
    ],
  }}
/>

These limitations are often tied to government surveillance concerns, economic policies favoring local telecom providers, or security issues. Despite these restrictions, WhatsApp remains immensely popular, with India leading as its largest market at over 480 million users. The UK also has a significant user base, with more than 40 million active accounts. Its extensive global reach and ability to sync across devices make it a go-to choice for many.

### Platform Compatibility

WhatsApp is available across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and WhatsApp Web. This flexibility allows users to switch between devices effortlessly, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

## 3. Viber

<SoftwareCard slug="viber" />

[Viber](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/viber) is a widely-used communication app with a strong global presence, particularly in Eastern Europe. It's especially popular in countries like Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine, and sees frequent use in regions such as Iraq, Libya, and Nepal.

### Cost

Viber offers free calls between users and an additional service, **Viber Out**, for calling landlines and mobiles internationally. Here's a breakdown of the pricing options for Viber Out:

- **World Unlimited Plan:** Unlimited calls to 60 countries for a flat monthly fee (introductory price of $5.99/month, including a one-week free trial).
- **Unlimited Country Plan:** Unlimited calls to a single country at a fixed rate.
- **Minutes Country Plan:** Prepaid minutes for specific countries.
- **World Credit:** Pay-as-you-go option using credits.

Call rates depend on whether you're dialing a mobile or landline and vary by region. Rates can change without prior notice, so it's a good idea to check the latest pricing regularly. These flexible plans make Viber a competitive option for international calling.

### Call Quality

With Viber Out, you can call any phone number worldwide. While the app aims to deliver clear audio, the quality can depend on factors like network stability and background noise. For the best experience, try these tips: minimize background noise, avoid heavy internet usage during calls, and use noise-canceling headphones or adjust the app's audio settings as needed.

### Geographic Coverage

Viber operates in over 190 countries, connecting users to both mobile and landline numbers across the globe. However, like many VoIP services, it faces restrictions in certain regions, such as China, Egypt, Pakistan, and the UAE, where VoIP services may be limited or blocked.

### Platform Compatibility

Viber supports multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and web browsers. Users register with their phone number, and the app remains accessible on desktops even without a mobile connection. Viber syncs seamlessly across devices, allowing users to manage calls and credits from any platform.

## 4. Google Voice

<SoftwareCard slug="voice" />

[Google Voice](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/voice) is tailored specifically for Google Workspace users, combining international calling with seamless integration into Google's suite of services. It's an appealing choice for businesses and professionals looking for streamlined communication tools. Below, we'll dive into its pricing, call quality, regional availability, and compatibility.

### Cost

Google Voice uses a subscription-based pricing model with three tiers:

- **Starter plan**: $10 per user per month
- **Standard plan**: $20 per user per month
- **Premier plan**: $30 per user per month
- _Note_: A Google Workspace subscription (starting at $6/month) is also required.

Subscribers in the U.S. and Canada - or in Europe when calling within Europe - can enjoy unlimited calling. For calls outside these regions, charges vary based on destination, ranging from $0.01 per minute to over $1.00 per minute. Here's a quick look at some international rates:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Destination", "Rate per Minute"],
    rows: [
      ["Australia (Landline)", "$0.01"],
      ["China (Landline)", "$0.04"],
      ["Abkhazia", "$0.18"],
      ["Afghanistan", "$0.27"],
      ["Cuba", "$0.70"],
    ],
  }}
/>

Rates are determined solely by the call destination, and premium numbers are blocked for security and cost control.

### Call Quality

Google Voice offers dependable, cloud-based call quality. Calls are processed using the G.711 codec, which delivers sound quality comparable to traditional landlines. Additionally, Google Voice promises a 99.9% uptime guarantee.

For the best experience, users need a stable connection with latency below 100 milliseconds and bandwidth exceeding 50 kbps. Factors like network stability, available bandwidth, and interference from proxies or packet inspection tools can impact performance. If issues arise, they're typically linked to either the user's internet connection or Google Voice's servers.

### Geographic Coverage

Google Voice is primarily designed for business users but is only available in select regions. For Google Workspace customers, the service is accessible in the Continental U.S. (excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories), as well as in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

For expanded international calling options, the SIP Link feature is available in regions like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. However, this requires upgrading to the Standard subscription ($26 per user per month) or Premier subscription ($36 per user per month), along with additional fees for the SIP Link service. Users should also be aware that international calls made outside the U.S. might incur roaming charges from their mobile carrier. Texting is limited too - for instance, only U.S. users can send texts to Canada, and outbound calls to China may face restrictions due to Chinese telecom carriers.

### Platform Compatibility

Google Voice works seamlessly across iOS and Android devices and integrates flawlessly with Google Workspace apps like Gmail and Calendar. This makes it a convenient tool for businesses already invested in the Google ecosystem.

## 5. TextNow

TextNow stands out as an affordable option for international calling, following closely behind Google Voice. It provides **free unlimited calling and texting** within the U.S. and Canada, along with a real phone number and Wi-Fi calling, making it a great choice for users who prefer alternatives to traditional cellular plans.

### Cost

TextNow is designed to keep costs low. The app offers **free international calling** to select countries, with rates varying depending on the destination. Here's a quick look at some rates:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Destination", "Rate per Minute"],
    rows: [
      ["Mexico", "$0.00"],
      ["United Kingdom", "$0.00"],
      ["India", "$0.01"],
      ["China", "$0.02"],
    ],
  }}
/>

To make international calls, users need to purchase international credits. A one-time credit package of $4.99 is available. Plus, the app offers opportunities to earn credits and rewards to offset call costs.

For those needing more, TextNow also provides a **paid unlimited data plan** for $39.99 per month.

### Call Quality

TextNow offers dependable call quality, thanks to its "Call Connect" feature. However, the overall experience can vary depending on the stability of the network.

### Geographic Coverage

TextNow operates on **Sprint and T-Mobile networks** within the U.S. and Canada, while also supporting international calls to over 200 countries. The app is available in various regions, including Australia, India, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and Qatar. However, it is not officially accessible in some areas, such as Nigeria and the United Kingdom, without using a VPN. To maintain control over its service, TextNow has implemented measures to limit VPN usage and ensure access is restricted to its intended regions.

### Platform Compatibility

TextNow is compatible with both iOS and Android devices, offering flexibility for users. Its Wi-Fi calling feature ensures that you can stay connected without relying solely on cellular networks. The app integrates seamlessly with your device, providing a real phone number that functions like a traditional line while leveraging internet-based calling for cost savings. This wraps up our overview of TextNow's international calling features.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Each international calling app brings its own set of strengths and weaknesses, making it easier to find one that fits your needs. This review focuses on **affordability**, **call quality**, **platform compatibility**, and **privacy**. Below is a quick comparison of the key features for each app.

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["App", "Pros", "Cons"],
    rows: [
      [
        "Skype Alternatives",
        "Offers a range of options for various budgets; many provide free app-to-app calls",
        "Call quality can vary widely; some lack features needed for business use",
      ],
      [
        "WhatsApp",
        "Free for personal use; simple and user-friendly; includes end-to-end encryption",
        "Only supports app-to-app calls; business features come with conversation-based pricing",
      ],
      [
        "Viber",
        "Flexible with two calling options; affordable rates; secure with encryption",
        "Limited for business needs; requires 'Viber Out' for landline calls",
      ],
      [
        "Google Voice",
        "Competitive pricing starting at $10/month; integrates with Google Workspace; blocks spam with AI",
        "Requires a Google Workspace subscription ($7/month minimum); limited availability outside the U.S.",
      ],
      [
        "TextNow",
        "Free unlimited calls in the U.S. and Canada; includes a real phone number; supports Wi-Fi calling",
        "Ad-supported, which can affect the experience; limited international coverage without a VPN",
      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

This table highlights the trade-offs, helping you decide which app aligns with your priorities. Pricing ranges from **completely free options**, like WhatsApp for personal use, to structured business plans such as Google Voice. TextNow offers affordable credit packages for those needing international coverage.

Call quality, while generally good, depends heavily on your network stability - even with secure and reliable platforms. Beyond cost and quality, factors like **security**, **regional availability**, and **ease of use** play a big role in choosing the right app.

### Security and Privacy

Privacy is a major concern for international calling. [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp), for example, uses **end-to-end encryption**, ensuring your conversations remain private. [Google Voice](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/voice), on the other hand, employs **multi-factor authentication** and user permissions, adding an extra layer of security.

### Geographic Limitations

Your location can also influence your decision. TextNow, for instance, has restrictions in certain regions and may limit VPN usage. Always check if the app supports your region before committing.

### Platform Compatibility

Some apps shine in their compatibility across devices. Google Voice and TextNow, for example, work on multiple platforms, making them ideal for users who switch between devices. By contrast, apps like WhatsApp and Viber are more focused on mobile users.

> "Google Voice is my VoIP of choice. We've been using it for several years now. It's easy to set up, is already set up with Gmail, and is super convenient. It uses AI to block spam calls, and it integrates with Google Calendar, which is so cool. Sometimes, the voicemail transcription can be a little weird, but that's my only major complaint about it. Everything else I love about Google Voice: I don't see myself switching providers for a long time." - Martin Gasparian, Attorney and Owner of Maison Law

While apps like WhatsApp and TextNow are known for their simplicity, Google Voice stands out for its business-friendly features and seamless integration with Google Workspace. However, this also means it may take a bit more time to master.

## Conclusion

Picking the right international calling app boils down to your specific needs and how you plan to use it. For casual, personal use, **[WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp)** is a dependable option - perfect if you and your contacts are on the same app. But when it comes to professional communication, additional tools and features are often necessary.

For business users, **[Google Voice](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/voice)** is a standout choice. Starting at $10 per user per month, it integrates seamlessly with Google Workspace, making it ideal for teams that rely on Gmail and Calendar for their day-to-day operations.

If you're looking for a budget-friendly option, **TextNow** is worth considering. It offers free unlimited calls within North America, and its premium plan is available for just $9.99 per month.

Regional availability is another critical factor to keep in mind. Different apps may perform better - or even be restricted - depending on where you're located, so this could influence your decision.

At the end of the day, your choice should align with key factors like **cost**, **call quality**, **platform compatibility**, and **regional access**. Think about how often you make calls, where your contacts are located, and which features are most important to you. The goal is to find an app that fits your unique communication needs and ensures a smooth, reliable experience.

## FAQs

### What should I consider when choosing the best app for international calls?

Choosing the best app for international calls comes down to understanding your priorities - whether that's **cost**, **call quality**, or specific **features**. Start by thinking about how you'll use the app. For personal calls, free apps that require both users to have the app and an internet connection can be ideal. These are perfect for casual conversations and often deliver great audio quality without charging a dime.

If you're looking for more flexibility - like calling landlines or mobile numbers without needing the other person to install the app - consider options with transparent pricing and dependable call quality. These are especially handy for business or professional calls. Think about the countries you call most frequently, whether affordability or extras like voicemail and customer support are more important, and how user-friendly the app feels.

Your final choice should align with your calling habits and what matters most to you.
