Virtual meetings have become a staple of modern work life, but many teams still struggle with making them effective and engaging. Here are proven strategies that work across any platform.

## Before the Meeting

### 1. Have a Clear Purpose

Every meeting should have a specific objective. Ask yourself: Could this be an email instead? If you're proceeding with a meeting, share the purpose in advance so participants come prepared.

### 2. Create and Share an Agenda

A structured agenda helps keep discussions on track. Include:
- Topics to cover
- Time allocations for each topic
- Required pre-reading or preparation
- Clear roles (facilitator, note-taker, timekeeper)

### 3. Test Your Tech

Technical issues can derail even the best-planned meetings. Before important calls:
- Check your internet connection
- Test your microphone and camera
- Ensure your platform is updated
- Practice screen sharing if needed

## During the Meeting

### 1. Start with Connection

Begin with a quick check-in or icebreaker to build rapport, especially in remote teams. This could be as simple as asking everyone to share a win from the past week.

### 2. Facilitate Actively

Good facilitation ensures everyone contributes:
- Call on quieter participants directly
- Use the chat function for quick responses
- Utilize breakout rooms for smaller discussions
- Employ virtual whiteboards for collaborative ideation

### 3. Combat Zoom Fatigue

Virtual meeting fatigue is real. Counter it by:
- Building in screen breaks
- Keeping meetings under 45 minutes when possible
- Encouraging camera-optional policies for some meetings
- Using asynchronous communication when appropriate

## After the Meeting

Follow up promptly with meeting notes, action items, and decisions made. Clear accountability and next steps ensure the meeting translates into progress.

Master these fundamentals, and you'll run effective virtual meetings regardless of which platform you're using.
