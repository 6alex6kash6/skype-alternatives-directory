## Detailed Platform Reviews

### 1. Microsoft Teams

<SoftwareCard slug="microsoft-teams" />

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/microsoft-teams) combines calling, messaging, and collaboration tools into one powerful platform. With an impressive 320 million active users each month, it has become a go-to solution for businesses looking to streamline communication and teamwork.

#### Key Features

Microsoft Teams is packed with tools that make communication and collaboration effortless. It supports individual and group chats, audio and video calls, document sharing, and even integrates with Outlook calendars. Features like breakout rooms, whiteboards, meeting notes, and polling enhance its usability for meetings and workshops. Teams also works seamlessly with Microsoft 365 apps like Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, along with third-party tools like Asana, Canva, Jira, and Workday.

The platform organizes communication into channels - either private or public - which act as hubs for specific teams, projects, or topics. On the security front, Teams is equipped with SSO, MFA, data encryption, data loss prevention, and advanced threat protection.

#### Pricing

Microsoft Teams offers options for every budget, from a free plan to premium business packages:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Plan", "Monthly Cost", "Annual Cost", "Key Features"],
    rows: [
      [
        "Free Plan",
        "$0",
        "$0",
        "60-minute group meetings (up to 100 participants), chat support, file sharing, 5 GB cloud storage",
      ],
      [
        "Teams Essentials",
        "$4.80",
        "$48",
        "Unlimited 30-hour meetings (up to 300 participants), 10 GB storage, phone and web support",
      ],
      [
        "Microsoft 365 Business Basic",
        "$7.20",
        "$72",
        "Essentials features plus custom email, 1 TB storage, and browser-based Office apps",
      ],
      [
        "Microsoft 365 Business Standard",
        "$15.00",
        "$150",
        "Adds webinars and desktop Office apps to Business Basic features",
      ],
      [
        "Microsoft 365 Business Premium",
        "$26.40",
        "$264",
        "Includes everything in Business Standard plus advanced security tools",
      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

The free plan is a great starting point for personal use, while the paid plans offer a range of features tailored to small businesses and large organizations alike.

#### Best Use Cases

Microsoft Teams stands out in professional and educational environments. Businesses benefit from its integration with Microsoft 365, making it easy to manage projects, host meetings, and collaborate on documents. Remote and hybrid teams appreciate its ability to handle everything from quick check-ins to large-scale webinars with up to 300 participants. For schools and universities, Teams supports classroom learning and administrative tasks, with tools for extended training sessions and workshops lasting up to 30 hours.

#### Limitations

While Teams offers a lot, it does come with a few challenges. Users have reported high resource usage and occasional issues with authentication, video quality, and screen sharing. The interface can feel overwhelming for newcomers, requiring some training to navigate effectively. Additionally, there are limits to consider: 250 participants in chats, 20 in video calls, and a 250 GB cap on file uploads.

Despite these drawbacks, Microsoft Teams provides a feature-rich and cost-effective option for businesses and individuals, making it a worthy successor to Skype.

### 2. Zoom

<SoftwareCard slug="zoom" />

As Skype steps back, [Zoom](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/zoom) has stepped up as a go-to communication platform, offering a mix of video meetings, messaging, phone services, and file sharing - all powered by AI. With over 2,000 apps available in the Zoom App Marketplace, it's a versatile tool for businesses looking for a comprehensive communication solution.

#### Key Features

Zoom's standout features include HD video and audio conferencing, instant messaging, file sharing, and phone services. A key addition is its **AI Companion**, included in all paid plans, which can summarize meetings, analyze documents and chats, brainstorm ideas, and even create content tailored for marketing and sales teams.

> "When you have separate platforms for video conferencing, enterprise chat, document collaboration, and file sharing, and a portfolio of cloud-based or on-premises phone systems, managing your business communications can be complicated and costly."

Zoom also boasts strong security measures like advanced encryption and robust access controls, along with an impressive 99.999% SLA uptime guarantee. The free Basic plan supports unlimited one-on-one meetings and group meetings for up to 100 participants, though sessions are capped at 40 minutes.

#### Pricing

Zoom's pricing caters to a wide range of users, from individuals to large enterprises:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Plan", "Monthly Cost", "Annual Cost", "Key Features"],
    rows: [
      [
        "Basic (Free)",
        "$0",
        "$0",
        "100 participants, 40-minute group meetings, basic features",
      ],
      [
        "Pro",
        "$16.99",
        "$13.33/month",
        "1–99 users, 100 participants, 30-hour meetings, 10 GB storage",
      ],
      [
        "Business",
        "$21.99",
        "$18.33/month",
        "1–250 users, 300 participants, unlimited whiteboards",
      ],
      [
        "Enterprise",
        "Custom",
        "Custom",
        "250+ licenses, 1,000 participants, unlimited storage",
      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

Additional services include **Zoom Phone** ($10/month), **Zoom Rooms** ($49/room/month), and **Zoom Webinars** (starting at $79/month).

#### Best Use Cases

Zoom is ideal for professional settings where reliable, high-quality communication is non-negotiable. Its user-friendly design makes it a solid choice for organizations new to digital communication tools. Businesses benefit from its all-in-one approach, while its webinars have been shown to achieve a 55% conversion rate, making it a strong option for marketing and outreach efforts.

#### Limitations

Despite its many strengths, Zoom isn't without its flaws. Security concerns linger, especially after the April 2020 incidents where hackers disrupted meetings, raising questions about data privacy. Users have also reported technical issues, such as slow loading times and difficulties joining calls. Customer service can be frustrating, with complaints about automated responses and upselling tactics.

The free plan has notable restrictions: no cloud recording (only local storage is available), limited polling options, no live streaming to platforms like YouTube or Facebook, and no access to the AI Companion. Additionally, free users are limited to chatbot and knowledge base support, which can be a hurdle for troubleshooting.

Billing practices have also caused frustration for some users, with reports of VAT charges being added unexpectedly after payment confirmation. And while the 40-minute limit on free group meetings can be restrictive, the Basic plan still offers a solid set of features for a free option.

For businesses that prioritize security and budget-conscious solutions, these limitations are worth considering when deciding if Zoom is the right fit.

### 3. Google Meet

<SoftwareCard slug="google-meet" />

[Google Meet](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/google-meet) is a widely-used video conferencing tool, with over 300 million people relying on it each month. It offers a straightforward yet effective solution for virtual meetings, blending ease of use with features designed for modern communication needs.

#### Key Features

One of Google Meet's standout qualities is its integration with Google Workspace. This allows users to effortlessly schedule and join meetings through Gmail or Google Calendar and collaborate in real time on Docs, Sheets, and Slides during calls. The platform supports up to 100 participants by default, with up to 49 visible on screen at once. For larger organizations, enterprise plans expand capacity to 1,000 participants, enable live streaming for up to 100,000 viewers, and extend meeting durations to 24 hours on paid plans.

Other highlights include real-time captions available in 69 languages and dynamic layouts that focus on the active speaker. Google Meet prioritizes security with data encryption during transit and advanced access controls. Additionally, AI tools for meeting summaries and content creation are available, though these require the Gemini Business add-on.

> "Because Google Chat and Google Meet are so easy to use and can be rolled out very quickly, Kärcher employees worldwide adopted these new channels of communication overnight and with minimal training…we've noticed an increased culture of collaboration and autonomy." – Daniel Hermann, Executive Director, Zoi Consulting

#### Pricing

Google Meet offers a range of plans to suit different needs:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: [
      "Plan",
      "Monthly Cost",
      "Annual Cost (per month)",
      "Participants",
      "Key Features",
    ],
    rows: [
      ["Free", "$0", "$0", "100", "60-minute meetings, basic features"],
      [
        "Business Starter",
        "$8.40",
        "$7.20",
        "100",
        "30GB storage, custom email, 24-hour meetings",
      ],
      [
        "Business Standard",
        "$16.80",
        "$14.40",
        "150",
        "2TB storage, recording, noise cancellation",
      ],
      [
        "Business Plus",
        "$26.40",
        "$22.00",
        "500",
        "5TB storage, attendance tracking, eDiscovery",
      ],
      [
        "Enterprise",
        "Custom",
        "Custom",
        "1,000",
        "Live streaming, advanced security",
      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

For enhanced functionality, an AI add-on is available at $20 per user per month (billed annually). Notably, the Business Starter plan costs $7.20 per month, making it a more affordable option compared to Zoom's Pro plan at $14.99.

Google Meet strikes a balance between security and collaboration, making it versatile enough for small teams and large enterprises alike.

#### Best Use Cases

Google Meet shines in environments where Google Workspace is already in use. Educational institutions, small to mid-sized businesses, and organizations focused on accessibility often find it particularly useful. Its intuitive interface enables teams to adopt it quickly without extensive training, and its consistent performance across mobile and desktop platforms ensures reliability for global teams managing diverse communication needs.

#### Limitations

Despite its many strengths, Google Meet has a few drawbacks. The free plan limits group meetings to 60 minutes, which can disrupt longer discussions. While users can restart meetings with new links to bypass this, it can interrupt workflows. Additionally, the platform lacks a built-in whiteboard feature - a common tool in many other video conferencing solutions. Optimal performance often depends on Google Workspace integration, which might not suit every organization. Some users have also reported issues, such as inconsistent notifications for group calls and limited camera displays in larger meetings. PCMag rates Google Meet 4.0 out of 5, praising its simplicity and AI tools but noting the absence of whiteboard functionality and its reliance on Google Workspace.

### 4. Jami

<SoftwareCard slug="jami" />

[Jami](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/jami) takes a unique approach to communication by ditching central servers and embracing a peer-to-peer network, putting privacy and security front and center.

#### Key Features

Jami stands out with its distributed, peer-to-peer setup, meaning your data goes directly between devices - no middleman involved. It uses advanced end-to-end encryption with forward secrecy to protect messages, calls, and file transfers, adhering to modern protocols and SIP standards based on X.509. Plus, you can create an account without sharing any personal details, ensuring complete anonymity.

The platform offers a wide range of features, including instant messaging, audio and video calls, group chats, video conferencing, screen sharing, and file sharing. It also functions as a SIP client and supports offline communication within local networks. Jami is available across all major platforms, including Linux, Android, AndroidTV, Windows, macOS, and iOS, making it a versatile choice for secure communication.

#### Pricing

Jami is entirely free. It's an open-source project licensed under the GNU GPLv3 and supported by the Free Software Foundation. There are no ads, and your data isn't collected. The project is sustained through donations, customization contracts, and business services provided by its developers at Savoir-Faire Linux Inc.

#### Best Use Cases

Jami is ideal for situations where privacy and security are non-negotiable. Whether it's healthcare professionals conducting telehealth sessions, legal teams managing sensitive cases, or financial advisors handling confidential client data, Jami's focus on security makes it a reliable choice. It's also a great fit for organizations seeking secure internal communication or on-premise solutions.

Christophe Villemer, Advocacy Vice President at Jami, explains:

> "Today, it's a fully peer-to-peer secure environment of communication. It allows people to communicate one on one or one to many."

The offline communication feature makes Jami especially useful in areas with limited internet connectivity, while its decentralized nature appeals to those who prefer to avoid centralized platforms. For businesses, JAMS offers enterprise-level user management and directory integration.

#### Limitations

Jami's peer-to-peer design, though excellent for privacy, has some downsides. Messages are only delivered when both users are online, which can be inconvenient for asynchronous conversations. Additionally, messages don't sync across devices, meaning you might miss conversations if you switch between, say, your phone and computer. Video quality can also vary, as it depends on the direct connection between users - this can be a challenge in areas with poor internet or during long-distance calls.

These trade-offs make Jami a better choice for those who value privacy above convenience and are willing to adjust their communication habits to take full advantage of its security features.

### 5. Chanty

<SoftwareCard slug="chanty" />

[Chanty](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/chanty) is a communication tool designed for messaging, video calls, and task management. Trusted by over 75,000 companies, it emphasizes ease of use while still offering a robust set of features. Teams using Chanty report saving up to 3 hours daily.

#### Key Features

One of Chanty's standout features is its **Teambook**, which organizes communication, tasks, files, and links into a single, searchable hub. The platform supports audio and video calls for up to 1,000 participants, along with voice messaging. You can also turn messages into tasks with just one click and manage them visually using a Kanban board. For added convenience, Chanty offers unlimited message history even on its free plan, and it integrates smoothly with popular tools - all within an intuitive interface.

#### Pricing

Chanty keeps its pricing simple. The **free plan** accommodates up to 5 team members, providing unlimited message history, 1-on-1 audio and video calls, and basic task management features. For larger teams, the **Business plan** costs $3 per user per month when billed annually (or $4 for monthly billing). This plan includes unlimited team members, group video calls, advanced task management, and priority support. Non-profit organizations can benefit from a 50% discount on paid plans.

#### Best Use Cases

Chanty is ideal for small to medium-sized teams seeking straightforward communication tools without unnecessary complexity. It's particularly handy for startups and agile teams aiming to boost productivity.

Josh Arnold, Executive Director at Mission Circle, highlights how Chanty supports his organization:

> "We have hundreds of members and volunteers who need to connect and collaborate daily. It would be impossible to expect everyone to share their cell phone numbers with one another or try to use email. An instant and group messaging platform where conversations can be organized in different threads is the best solution for meeting our collaboration goals."

Chanty is also a great fit for remote and distributed teams, offering both synchronous and asynchronous communication options. Amilcar De Carvalho, Creative Director at Battalion Media, shares why Chanty works for him:

> "Slack was too slow for my phone, and didn't have audio messages, which is crucial for me as I enjoy working while walking with my dog in nature and Microsoft was too complex to use. Finally no more whatsapp for communications and audio messages, which makes us extremely focused."

#### Limitations

While Chanty's simplicity is a strength, it does come with some trade-offs. The platform offers fewer integrations compared to more established competitors, and users have occasionally reported unstable group video calls. Additionally, customer support options are limited, and the mobile app, rated 3.7/5 on Google Play, may not meet the expectations of teams heavily reliant on mobile communication.

Despite these drawbacks, many users appreciate Chanty's practical approach. Julia Dadds from Pyramid Coaches sums it up well:

> "I like the simplicity of the platform and yet it has the major features we need."

### 6. Cisco Webex

<SoftwareCard slug="webex" />

[Cisco Webex](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/webex) is a well-established, enterprise-level communication platform trusted by 95% of Fortune 500 companies. It combines meetings, messaging, calling, and contact center solutions with advanced AI features, making it a go-to choice for businesses that need secure and reliable communication tools.

#### Key Features

Webex shines with its AI-powered tools designed to simplify tasks and improve efficiency. Its AI Agent and Assistant handle customer self-service, remove background noise, translate conversations into over 100 languages in real time, and even generate meeting summaries with action items. For contact centers, the platform provides automated guidance, context, and summaries to help agents handle customer interactions more effectively.

The platform supports secure, high-quality meetings with integrated audio, video, and content sharing across devices. Its device integration is impressive, with features like Apple AirPlay support on Cisco devices, a Ceiling Microphone Pro with AI-enhanced voice capture, and Cisco Spatial Meetings for Apple Vision Pro, which creates a 3D video environment.

For organizations prioritizing security, Webex offers strong encryption, a native VDI client, and sovereign controls, which allow users to manage their own encryption keys.

#### Pricing

Webex offers flexible pricing to suit various needs:

- **Free Plan**: Unlimited meetings up to 40 minutes for up to 100 participants.
- **Webex Meet**: $144 per user annually (or $12 monthly). This includes AI Assistant features, meetings lasting up to 24 hours, support for 200 participants, and 10 GB of AI-powered cloud recording.
- **Webex Suite**: $270 per user annually (or $22.50 monthly). It combines meetings and calling, offering a business phone number, unlimited domestic calling, visual voicemail, and 6-way conference calling.
- **Webex Enterprise**: Tailored for larger organizations, it supports up to 1,000 participants and includes FedRAMP-authorized security. Pricing is available upon request. Additional options include Webex Calling (from $17 per license monthly) and Webex Webinars (starting at $68.75 per license monthly for up to 1,000 attendees).

#### Best Use Cases

Webex is particularly effective in enterprise settings where security, scalability, and integration are essential. Companies like T-Mobile Business Group, McLaren Racing, and Broadcom rely on it for critical operations.

It's also an excellent choice for organizations needing contact center solutions. For instance, Webex Calling Customer Assist is ideal for IT help desks, HR support lines, and front desk operations that require basic inbound voice capabilities without a full contact center setup.

Small and medium-sized businesses with fewer than 250 employees may find Webex for Cisco BroadWorks beneficial, as it offers collaboration tools for those already using BroadWorks calling services.

Several success stories highlight Webex's impact:

> "We have relied on Webex for nearly every aspect of our business over the past 2 years."
> – Callie Field, President of T-Mobile Business Group

> "The level of innovation we get with Webex makes it so much easier for us to run our business. Now, all the Webex services: meetings, video conference, room hardware, calling, and even our contact center, is all on one controlled app."
> – Stanley Toh, Broadcom

#### Limitations

While Webex offers a comprehensive suite of features, its pricing can be a hurdle for smaller organizations. As one user pointed out:

> "Price is slightly on the costlier side… not well suited for small scale organisations due to price constraints"

Nevertheless, many businesses find the platform's extensive capabilities and robust security worth the investment.

## Comparison of Features and Drawbacks

When comparing communication platforms, it's clear that each one has its own strengths and limitations. The best choice depends on your team's specific needs, budget, and size. Here's an overview of how six popular options stack up across key categories:

      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

This table provides a quick snapshot of each platform's pricing, target audience, and standout features. Let's dive deeper into pricing, usability, and functionality to help you make an informed decision.

### Pricing Comparison

For budget-conscious teams, Jami offers a completely free solution, while Chanty is one of the lowest-cost paid options at $4 per user per month. Microsoft Teams is slightly higher at $4.80 per user, while Zoom's Pro plan starts at $12.49 per month. Cisco Webex typically requires custom pricing, making it better suited for enterprise-level organizations with larger budgets.

### Ease of Use

When it comes to user experience, Chanty shines with its straightforward, intuitive interface, earning high ratings like 4.7/5 on Capterra and 4.5/5 on G2. Google Meet is another accessible option, as it runs directly in web browsers - ideal for users who prefer simplicity. On the other hand, Microsoft Teams can feel overwhelming due to its extensive features, and Jami's decentralized setup may pose challenges for less tech-savvy teams.

### Feature Depth

Zoom is a standout for its video quality and extensive integration options, but its AI tools could use refinement for greater meeting accuracy. Microsoft Teams and Google Meet both excel at combining video conferencing with real-time collaboration and app integrations. Cisco Webex takes it a step further with advanced AI features designed to boost productivity in enterprise settings. Chanty, while more basic, focuses on streamlined communication with features like messaging, video calls, and task management.

### Scalability

For smaller teams, Chanty's free plan and Jami's unlimited scaling are appealing options. Mid-sized businesses might find Microsoft Teams or Google Meet more suitable, especially if they're already part of the Microsoft or Google ecosystems. Larger enterprises often turn to Zoom or Cisco Webex for their ability to handle complex needs and larger user bases.

Each platform offers a unique blend of features and pricing, making it easier to align your choice with your team's requirements. Whether you prioritize budget, ease of use, or advanced functionality, there's a solution tailored to your communication needs.

### How is Jami different from popular platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams?

[Jami](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/jami) takes a different approach compared to platforms like [Zoom](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/zoom) and [Microsoft Teams](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/microsoft-teams) by prioritizing **privacy** and using a **decentralized system**. Instead of relying on central servers to handle communications, Jami uses a peer-to-peer model.

On top of that, Jami keeps its privacy policy straightforward and transparent. It collects only minimal, anonymous data for basic analytics.
