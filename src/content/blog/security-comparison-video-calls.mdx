With sensitive business discussions happening over video calls, security has become a top priority for teams selecting communication tools. This article breaks down the security features of leading platforms to help you make informed decisions.

## End-to-End Encryption

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) ensures that only the communicating users can read the messages. Even the platform provider cannot access the content. Here's how different platforms compare:

- **Zoom:** After initial controversies, Zoom now offers E2EE as an option, though enabling it limits some features.
- **Signal:** Provides E2EE by default for all communications.
- **Microsoft Teams:** Uses encryption in transit and at rest, but not true E2EE for all content.
- **Google Meet:** Encrypts data in transit but doesn't offer E2EE.

## Data Privacy Policies

Understanding how platforms handle your data is crucial:

- **Zoom:** Has improved its privacy policies after scrutiny, now offering clearer controls over data sharing.
- **Discord:** Collects user data for platform improvements and targeted advertising.
- **Slack:** Stores messages and files on their servers, with access controls determined by workspace admins.

## Security Best Practices

Regardless of which platform you choose, follow these best practices:

1. Use meeting passwords when available
2. Leverage waiting rooms to vet participants
3. Regularly update your communication apps
4. Be cautious about what you share on screen
5. Consider the sensitivity of your discussions when selecting a platform

Security should always be a top consideration when selecting communication tools for your team or personal use.
