## Signal vs. WhatsApp vs. Telegram (Who Wins?)

<YouTube id="_8CF3HXjtO8" />

## 1. Signal

<SoftwareCard slug="signal" />

[Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) stands out as a top choice for secure international communication, and the best part? It's completely free. According to Signal.org:

> "Privacy isn't an optional mode - it's just the way that Signal works. Every message, every call, every time."

With roughly 70 million monthly users and over 220 million downloads worldwide, [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) has become a trusted platform for privacy-focused communication.

### Security Features

At the heart of [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal)'s design is its end-to-end encryption, powered by the open-source Signal Protocol. This encryption ensures that no one - not even [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) - can access your messages or calls. Additional features like "sealed sender", which hides recipient identities, and "perfect forward secrecy", which secures past conversations even if encryption keys are compromised, further bolster its security.

To add another layer of protection, [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) allows users to verify safety numbers and QR codes, helping to detect potential interception attempts. Its transparency is also a major strength - [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal)'s open-source code is publicly available and undergoes regular audits by security experts. Plus, the app avoids storing metadata about your conversations and ensures messages are deleted securely, even from online backups.

### Cost for International Use

[Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal)'s pricing model couldn't be simpler - it's entirely free. The app uses your phone's data connection or Wi-Fi for all communications. Whether you're chatting with someone across the street or across the globe, there are no subscription fees, per-minute charges, or hidden costs. All you need is an internet connection, and the app functions exactly as it would back home.

[Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) also supports group calls with up to 50 participants and group chats that can include as many as 1,000 users, making it versatile for both personal and professional use.

### Global Accessibility

While [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) is accessible worldwide, some regions, such as China, Russia, and Venezuela, have blocked the app due to censorship. To counteract this, [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) employs domain fronting technology in restricted areas. As of May 2022, this feature is automatically enabled in countries like Egypt, the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Iran, Cuba, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan.

### Call and Messaging Quality

[Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) delivers reliable voice and video calls, which depend on the quality of your internet connection. Messages, including multimedia, are sent smoothly and securely. For enhanced privacy, users are encouraged to enable disappearing messages, keep software updated, and disable sender names and message previews on lock screens. Adding password protection to the app is another smart way to safeguard your data.

With its strong focus on privacy, zero-cost model, and dependable performance, [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) remains a top choice for secure international communication. While it does face some geographic restrictions, its commitment to user privacy makes it a standout option. Up next, we'll take a look at another leading app to see how it compares in terms of security and features.

## 2. Telegram

<SoftwareCard slug="telegram" />

As of July 2024, [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) has amassed a staggering 950 million users, offering a blend of powerful features and customizable privacy settings. Unlike [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal), which prioritizes privacy above all else, [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) strikes a balance between usability and security.

### Security Features

[Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) employs a mix of security protocols tailored to meet varying user needs. For Secret Chats, it uses **end-to-end encryption**, while regular chats rely on server-client encryption. Additional features include self-destructing messages, two-step verification, and detailed privacy controls, allowing users to manage who can see their phone number, last seen status, and profile picture. However, end-to-end encryption is not enabled by default for regular chats, which means [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) technically has access to these messages. Despite this, the company asserts it has never shared private messages with third parties:

> "All Telegram servers belong to Telegram and are maintained by Telegram employees. Unauthorized access is impossible. Throughout its entire history, Telegram never disclosed any private messages to a third party - and its encryption has never been breached."
> – Remi Vaughn, Telegram's head of Press and Media Relations

[Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) also stands out for its **open API and protocol**, allowing independent security audits. Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, further bolstering its security framework.

### Cost for International Use

[Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) operates on a freemium model, making it especially attractive for global communication. Core messaging and calling features are free, with no ads or subscription fees. Voice and video calls are secured with end-to-end encryption and use optimized codecs to reduce data consumption. For those seeking added perks like unlimited cloud storage and animated emojis, [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) offers a premium subscription priced at **$5 per month** or **$36 annually**.

### Global Accessibility

Despite its popularity, [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) faces restrictions in several countries due to regulatory and security concerns. For instance, Vietnam blocked the app in May 2025, citing that 68% of its 9,600 channels and groups contained problematic content. This was a significant move, considering Vietnam is one of [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram)'s largest markets, with over 11.8 million users. Similarly, China has banned [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) since July 2015, primarily due to its use by human rights lawyers critical of the government. Russia also imposed a temporary ban from April 2018 to June 2020 before eventually lifting restrictions.

### Call and Messaging Quality

[Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) ensures smooth international communication with a **peer-to-peer connection system**. When direct connections aren't possible, the platform automatically switches to the nearest server. Advanced audio codecs and **AI-powered neural networks** help fine-tune call quality based on user feedback. Additionally, users can control who can call them, with the option to disable voice calls entirely if preferred. Its **cloud-based design** allows seamless syncing across devices, enabling users to effortlessly switch between phones, tablets, and computers during conversations.

With its mix of functionality and privacy, [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) sets the stage for a closer look at [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp)'s approach to user security next.

## 3. WhatsApp

<SoftwareCard slug="whatsapp" />

With an impressive **2.9 billion unique users**, [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) stands as a global leader in messaging, especially in regions where SMS costs are steep.

### Security Features

[WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) prioritizes privacy with **end-to-end encryption** enabled by default for personal messages, calls, photos, and videos. This encryption relies on the same Signal protocol that powers [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal)'s robust security framework. As the platform emphasizes:

> "Privacy and security is in our DNA, which is why we built end-to-end encryption into our app."

To bolster privacy further, [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) offers features like **disappearing messages**, **chat locks**, and **end-to-end encrypted backups**. Users can control who sees their online status, profile photo, and even who can add them to groups. Additional safeguards include **proactive security alerts**, **automatic spam detection**, and **two-step verification**.

[WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) is also exploring "Private Processing" for AI tools. As Head Will Cathcart explains:

> "Many people want to use AI tools to help them when they are messaging. We think building a private way to do that is important, because people shouldn't have to switch to a less-private platform to have the functionality they need."

However, [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) does collect metadata, such as details about who you communicate with and when.

### Cost for International Use

[WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) is free for messaging and calls, with costs limited to mobile data usage, especially when roaming. While calls and messages are free over Wi-Fi, using mobile data abroad can result in charges of up to $10–15 per MB. Voice calls typically consume 300–500 KB per minute, while video calls use about 3–5 MB per minute. As one source notes:

> "Calling internationally using WhatsApp itself costs nothing. But the calls are only genuinely 'free' when you're connected to Wi‑Fi that you're already paying for or can use freely."

### Global Accessibility

Despite its massive reach, [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) faces restrictions in several countries due to government censorship and policies targeting its encryption. For instance, **China has blocked WhatsApp since 2017**, while countries like North Korea, Syria, and Iran have imposed full bans. Additionally, nations such as Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt restrict [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp)'s voice and video calling features. In a notable move, Chinese authorities required Apple to block [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) downloads on Chinese iPhones in April 2024.

Yet, millions of users in restricted regions continue to access [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) through workarounds. As Will Cathcart shared:

> "We have a lot of anecdotal reports of people using WhatsApp and what we can do is look at some of the countries where we're seeing blocking and still see tens of millions of people connecting to WhatsApp."

To address such challenges, [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) introduced a **proxy service in June 2023**, enabling users to bypass censorship and internet shutdowns. The company explains:

> "Choosing a proxy enables you to connect to WhatsApp through servers set up by volunteers and organizations around the world dedicated to helping people communicate freely."

### Call and Messaging Quality

The quality of [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp)'s calls and messages largely depends on the user's internet connection. With a massive user base - including over 480 million users in India alone - [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) continues to set the standard for international messaging platforms.

Next, we'll evaluate these platforms based on key privacy and functionality metrics.

## Comparison of Features and Drawbacks

Choosing the right privacy app means balancing security, cost, and usability. Each platform prioritizes these aspects differently, which can significantly shape your communication experience.

**[Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal)** takes the lead in privacy by default, offering end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for all chats and calls while collecting only your phone number and minimal metadata. According to [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/), [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) provides stronger privacy protections compared to [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) and [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp). These distinctions set the stage for a deeper comparison.

**[WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp)** also employs the Signal Protocol for encryption, ensuring E2EE for non-business messages. However, it collects more data and shares some information with its parent company, [Meta](https://www.meta.com/). A [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) spokesperson stated:

> "WhatsApp has no backdoors and we have no evidence of vulnerabilities in how WhatsApp works... We have a proven track record addressing issues we identify and have worked to hold bad actors accountable."

**[Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram)**, on the other hand, only offers E2EE in its "Secret Chats", while regular chats rely on client-server encryption. Additionally, [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) collects IP addresses and may share data with law enforcement when required.

Here's a side-by-side comparison of key features:

        "Highly customizable",
        "Limited to 1-day minimum",
        "Limited customization",
      ],
    ],

All three apps are available on major platforms - Android, iOS, and web. However, their disappearing message features vary. [Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) provides the most flexibility, letting users set timers from seconds to weeks. [Telegram](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/telegram) limits automatic deletion to a minimum of one day, while [WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp) offers only basic options.
