## Detailed App Reviews

### 1. WhatsApp

<SoftwareCard slug="whatsapp" />

[WhatsApp](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/whatsapp), with close to 1 billion monthly users, offers a seamless blend of text and video communication. While iMessage dominates in the U.S., WhatsApp remains a reliable tool for personal connections worldwide. Let's break down some of its standout features.

The platform supports video calls with up to 32 participants, accessible across both smartphones and computers. With over 2 billion calls made daily, its dependability is clear.

#### Security You Can Trust

Privacy is a cornerstone of WhatsApp. Every video call is protected with end-to-end encryption powered by the Signal protocol. This ensures only you and the participants can access the conversation. As WhatsApp puts it:

> "Privacy and security is in our DNA, which is why we built end-to-end encryption into our app"

The app also protects IP addresses during calls and allows users to verify security by comparing codes with their contacts.

#### Enhanced Features for Better Calls

In April 2025, WhatsApp introduced updates that improved video quality, added a zoom feature, and optimized routing to reduce call drops. These updates also included better audio-visual controls. According to WhatsApp:

> "Our optimized routing system finds the best connection path, reducing dropped calls and video freezing. And our improved bandwidth detection quickly upgrades your video to HD quality for a more enjoyable experience"

Other features include pinch-to-zoom, adding participants mid-call, audio-supported screen sharing, and a 'speaker spotlight' option. Additionally, the Meta Low Bitrate (MLow) codec ensures smooth calls even on weak internet connections.

For iPhone users, WhatsApp can even be set as the default calling app. To maximize security, make sure to update to the latest version and enable two-step verification.

If you're already using WhatsApp for messaging, it's a fantastic choice for staying connected with friends and family through high-quality video calls.

### 2. Zoom

<SoftwareCard slug="zoom" />

If you're looking for a platform that blends professional-grade reliability with advanced features - without spending a dime - [Zoom](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/zoom) is a standout choice. Known for its polished video meeting experience, Zoom's free Basic plan caters to both personal and business users.

#### What You Get for Free

The Basic plan lets you host unlimited meetings for up to 100 participants, though group sessions are capped at 40 minutes. It also includes a range of useful features like breakout rooms, virtual backgrounds, co-annotation during screen sharing, automated captions, waiting rooms, and multi-participant spotlighting.

#### More Than Just Video Calls

Zoom's free plan isn't limited to video conferencing. It also offers tools like Team Chat for seamless communication, an integrated whiteboard for brainstorming, Zoom Notes for jotting down ideas, a Mail & Calendar client for staying organized, and Clips Basic for creating and sharing short videos. These extras make it a versatile tool that goes beyond traditional video meetings.

#### Dealing with the Time Limit

Worried about the 40-minute cap on group meetings? Simply end the session and restart it using the same link. Scheduling quick breaks can make this transition smoother.

#### Built for Professional Reliability

Zoom's reputation for dependability stems from its founder Eric Yuan's mission to eliminate the frustrations of outdated video conferencing tools. Many businesses have experienced a boost in efficiency thanks to Zoom. As Frank Menne, Managing Director of OctoGate IT Security Systems GmbH, shared:

> "Since we started using Zoom, we communicate better and work more efficiently. We have become much faster. In the way we develop things and how we respond to requests from partners and customers. With Zoom, we're much more agile."

#### Security You Can Trust

Zoom takes security seriously, offering features like passcodes, waiting rooms, two-factor authentication, and regular software updates to protect your meetings.

For small teams, frequent but short meetings, or anyone seeking a professional-grade video calling solution for free, the Basic plan is an excellent option - even with the 40-minute group session limit.

### 3. Google Meet

<SoftwareCard slug="google-meet" />

#### No Installations Needed

#### Free Plan: What to Know

The free version gives you unlimited one-on-one calls (up to 24 hours) and group meetings for up to 100 participants, capped at 60 minutes. If your group call hits the 60-minute mark, you'll need to create a new link and have everyone rejoin. However, keep in mind that live support isn't included in the free plan - you'll need to rely on Google's help documentation for assistance.

#### Built-In Security Features

Every Google Meet session is encrypted by default. According to Google Cloud:

> "Google Cloud customers own their data, not Google. The data that customers put into our systems is theirs, and we do not scan it for advertisements nor sell it to third parties."

### 6. Signal

<SoftwareCard slug="signal" />

[Signal](https://www.skypealternativelist.com/items/signal) puts privacy at the forefront of its video calling services. With an estimated 40–70 million monthly users, this non-profit platform has become a go-to choice for those who value encrypted communication and data security.

#### Built for Maximum Privacy

Signal ensures complete end-to-end encryption for every voice and video call. Using the open-source Signal Protocol, it guarantees that only you and the person you're speaking with can access the conversation - even Signal itself is locked out.

> "Privacy isn't an optional mode - it's just the way that Signal works. Every message, every call, every time." – Signal Support

The platform also includes features like screen protection to block screenshots. And since Signal operates as a non-profit, it doesn't rely on ads or user tracking to generate revenue. This means your data is never monetized.

#### Ideal for Smaller Groups

Signal's focus on privacy extends seamlessly to group calls. It supports secure video calls with up to 50 participants. To join, participants must have the latest app version and be part of the same chat group. Features like call links, a "raise hand" button, and emoji reactions enhance group interactions while maintaining a user-friendly experience. Importantly, group calls are just as private as one-on-one conversations. Signal employs Selective Forwarding technology to keep encryption intact and avoids storing group memberships or other identifiable data.

#### Trusted by Security Experts

Signal has earned the confidence of prominent individuals and organizations that deal with sensitive information. Meredith Whittaker, President of the Signal Foundation, highlights its widespread use:

> "Every military in the world uses Signal, every politician I'm aware of uses Signal. Every CEO I know uses Signal because anyone who has anything truly confidential to communicate recognizes that storing that on a Meta database or in the clear on some Google server is not good practice."

Signal's open-source design allows security experts to examine its protocols for transparency. Features like disappearing messages add another layer of protection by automatically erasing conversations after a set period. Users can also create Signal usernames, enabling anonymous communication without the need to share phone numbers. On top of that, Signal collects minimal metadata and keeps encryption active by default.
