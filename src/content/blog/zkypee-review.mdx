## The Story Behind Zkypee

<SoftwareCard slug="zkypee" />

With Microsoft officially shutting down Skype in May 2025, millions of users are scrambling to find alternatives. Enter Zkypee - an unlikely solution born from necessity. "There are some Columbia University students working on a Skype replacement", as discussed in expat forums, though it appears to be Colombian students rather than Columbia University students creating this ambitious project.

The timing couldn't be more critical. As one expat noted: "I have used a Skype number for years while traveling. It has been essential for me because I have banks that I need to get access codes when I travel." This exact pain point is what Zkypee aims to solve, positioning itself as "the perfect free Skype replacement with high-quality voice and video calls to anyone in the world."

## What Makes Zkypee Different

### Built for the Skype Exodus
While Microsoft pushes users toward Teams - a business-focused platform - Zkypee understands what actual Skype users need. The developers are actively seeking community input: "They're looking to incorporate 2fa capable sms, calls to landlines/mobiles, the ability to port your Skype number or buy a dedicated line. They are asking for feedback on features."

### Key Features in Development
- **2FA and Banking SMS**: "The biggest benefit is the banking SMS codes which is essential" - crucial for expats and travelers
- **Number Portability**: Port your existing Skype number to maintain continuity
- **Global Calling**: Call landlines and mobile phones worldwide
- **Dedicated Phone Numbers**: Buy numbers from multiple countries
- **Pay-As-You-Go Model**: Similar to Skype's credit system

## Current State and User Experience

### Early Adopter Feedback
The platform is still in active development, and early users report mixed experiences:

**Technical Issues:**
"Very buggy. Their site doesn't work. I tried signing up with my Google log in and it doesn't work at all." - Early tester

This suggests the platform is still ironing out technical challenges, which is expected for a student-led startup racing against Skype's shutdown deadline.

**Pricing Concerns:**
Initial confusion about pricing has emerged in user discussions:
- One user complained: "Their rates are nuts! 15 cents per call. No way that will work."
- However, clarification came: "Actually it says 3 cents a minute which was like Skype prices. Maybe even cheaper."

## Why Expats Are Watching Closely

The expat community has become Zkypee's most vocal potential user base. Forums from Buenos Aires to Colombia are buzzing with discussions about the service. The reasons are clear:

### Banking Access
For expats, maintaining access to home country banking is crucial. As one user explained: "It has been essential for me because I have banks that I need to get access codes when I travel or need to access my online account."

### Affordable International Calling
With Skype's affordable international rates disappearing, expats need alternatives that won't break the bank. Zkypee's promised 3 cents per minute pricing aligns with what users are accustomed to paying.

### Number Continuity
Many expats have used the same Skype number for years. The ability to port these numbers to Zkypee could be a game-changer for maintaining business and personal connections.

## The Developer Story

What makes Zkypee particularly interesting is its origin story. Created by Colombian students who recognized the gap Microsoft was creating by shutting down Skype, this project represents the entrepreneurial spirit of solving real problems.

The developers are taking a community-driven approach: "They're currently asking for opinions on the services users would want, so a great time to inform them if you're so inclined and you see they're missing something that'd be worth adding to the service."

## Current Limitations

### Technical Stability
As a beta product racing against time, Zkypee faces significant challenges:
- Website login issues reported by early testers
- Platform stability concerns
- Limited documentation and support

### Trust Building
"I won't trust it right away, would want to wait until there have been countless users to give feedback," noted one cautious potential user. This sentiment reflects the challenge any new communication platform faces - building trust takes time.

### Feature Completeness
While the roadmap is ambitious, many promised features are still "planned" rather than implemented. Users need these features before Skype's May 2025 shutdown.

## Should You Try Zkypee?

### Consider Zkypee If:
- You heavily rely on Skype for international calling
- You need 2FA/SMS support for banking
- You prefer pay-as-you-go pricing over subscriptions
- You want to support an indie alternative to big tech
- You're comfortable with beta software

### Look Elsewhere If:
- You need rock-solid reliability today
- You require extensive business features
- You're not comfortable troubleshooting technical issues
- You need immediate customer support

## The Bottom Line

Zkypee represents both the promise and peril of indie software development. Born from the real needs of Skype users abandoned by Microsoft, it's attempting to fill a genuine gap in the market. The Colombian students behind it are building exactly what the community is asking for - a true Skype replacement focused on international calling and SMS verification.

However, with Skype's shutdown looming and the platform still showing signs of early development bugs, potential users face a dilemma. As one forum member wisely noted: "if they're able to develop it properly, it sounds like it's going to be the perfect answer to Microsoft pulling the plug on so many of its dedicated Skype users."

For now, Zkypee remains a project worth watching. Follow their progress on Reddit at r/Zkypee and consider providing feedback to help shape a tool built by users, for users. Just maybe keep a backup communication method ready until the platform stabilizes.
