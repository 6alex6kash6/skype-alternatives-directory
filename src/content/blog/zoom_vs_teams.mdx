## Feature Comparison

Zoom and Microsoft Teams each shine in different areas, offering a variety of tools tailored to specific user needs.

### Video Conferencing

Zoom's free plan allows meetings with up to 100 participants for 40 minutes, while its Enterprise plan supports up to 500 participants, with an add-on available to increase capacity to 1,000. Microsoft Teams also accommodates 100 participants on its free plan, but its basic paid plan extends this to 300. For larger events, Teams can host up to 20,000 listen-only participants with Microsoft Office accounts or up to 10,000 for live events.

Both platforms deliver 1080p HD video at 30fps. However, in low-bandwidth conditions, Zoom tends to maintain better call quality, while Teams may experience some video degradation due to its system resource demands for collaboration tools. Zoom also simplifies guest access, making it easier for external participants to join meetings, whereas Teams is more suited for internal communication within organizations.

While video quality is comparable, the platforms differ significantly in their collaborative features.

### Collaboration Tools

Microsoft Teams integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Office, enabling real-time multi-user document editing. Zoom also supports live document collaboration, but the integration isn't as smooth.

For messaging, Teams offers a more comprehensive experience with persistent chat threads, advanced formatting options, and personalized stickers. These chats extend beyond individual meetings, making it a robust tool for ongoing communication. On the other hand, Zoom's chat features are simpler and primarily designed for in-meeting use.

In terms of storage, Teams provides 1 TB per user on its Basic plan, along with a built-in Wiki for company documentation. Zoom typically includes 5–10 GB of storage, with unlimited storage available only for Enterprise users.

Here's a quick comparison of key collaboration features:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Feature", "Zoom", "Teams"],
    rows: [
      [
        "Meeting Features",
        "Screen sharing, remote control, collaborative notes, whiteboard, breakout rooms, basic chat",
        "Persistent chat, advanced collaboration tools, whiteboard, action item lists, live document editing, Wiki",
      ],
      [
        "Integrations",
        "Wide range of third-party integrations",
        "Extensive third-party integrations with deep Microsoft 365 integration",
      ],
      [
        "Storage",
        "5–10 GB; unlimited for Enterprise users",
        "10 GB on Essentials; 1 TB for Business Basic and higher plans",
      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

Teams also includes built-in task management tools, while Zoom's "My Tasks" feature, still in beta, offers less integration. Zoom's extensive third-party integrations make it a flexible option for various workflows, while Teams' tight integration with Microsoft 365 creates a unified experience for users already in the Microsoft ecosystem.

### Meeting Setup and Interface

When it comes to usability, Zoom stands out for its straightforward meeting setup. Users can quickly create, start, or join sessions without much hassle. Teams, on the other hand, is optimized for those already familiar with Microsoft 365, but its interface can feel complex for new users.

Microsoft has taken steps to improve usability. In January 2025, Teams introduced a redesigned calendar experience, adding features like Copilot and Places for smarter time management. This update also brought calendar sharing, multiple viewing options (month and multi-day views), printing support, filtering, and multi-timezone capabilities.

Ultimately, user preference often depends on familiarity. Organizations already using Microsoft 365 tend to find Teams more intuitive, while Zoom's simpler design appeals to those seeking a more accessible option.

These differences highlight how each platform caters to specific business communication needs, helping organizations choose the solution that fits their workflows best.

## Pricing and Plans

Compare the pricing options to find the plan that best suits your needs.

### Free Plans

Both Zoom and Microsoft Teams offer free plans designed for individuals and small teams, but their features differ slightly.

Zoom's Basic plan allows group meetings with up to 100 participants, though sessions are capped at 40 minutes. It also includes team chat, three editable whiteboards, and automated meeting captions. However, it doesn't specify any cloud storage, which could be a drawback for users who need to save recordings or files.

Microsoft Teams' free plan, on the other hand, allows group meetings to run up to 60 minutes - giving you 50% more time than Zoom. It also supports 100 participants, offers unlimited one-on-one meetings lasting up to 30 hours, and provides 5 GB of cloud storage per user. Core features such as chat, file sharing, screen sharing, and live captions (in English) are included, although Teams lacks whiteboarding tools in its free tier.

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Feature", "Zoom Basic (Free)", "Microsoft Teams Free"],
    rows: [
      [
        "Meeting Duration Limit",
        "40 minutes",
        "60 minutes (group), unlimited 1:1 (30 hrs)",
      ],
      ["Participants Limit", "100", "100"],
      ["Cloud Storage", "Not specified", "5 GB per user"],
      ["Whiteboarding", "Yes (3 editable boards)", "No"],
      ["Live Captions", "Yes", "Yes (English only)"],
    ],
  }}
/>

For small teams or individuals, Microsoft Teams offers more meeting time and storage, while Zoom stands out with its whiteboarding capabilities.

### Paid Plans and Business Options

For businesses that require advanced features and larger capacities, the paid plans for both platforms reveal some key differences.

**Zoom's Pro plan** costs $13.33 per user per month (billed annually) or $16.99 on a monthly basis. It supports up to 100 participants, 30-hour meetings, and 10 GB of cloud storage. The Business plan, priced at $18.33 per user per month (billed annually), increases capacity to 300 participants, includes unlimited whiteboards, and adds admin scheduling tools.

> "Zoom pricing starts at **$13.33 per user, per month for Zoom Workplace**"

**Microsoft Teams Essentials** is priced lower, starting at $4.00 per user per month (billed annually). It supports 300 participants, 30-hour meetings, and 10 GB of cloud storage per user.

> "Microsoft Teams Essentials, costs $4 per user per month (when paid annually) and offer: Up to 300 participants per meeting, 10 GB of cloud storage per user, and 30 hours per meeting."

For added functionality, **Microsoft 365 Business Basic** costs $6.00 per user per month and bundles Teams with web and mobile versions of Office apps, plus 1 TB of cloud storage per user. The **Business Standard plan**, priced at $12.50 per user per month, includes desktop Office applications and webinar hosting features.

Zoom also offers add-ons for specialized needs, such as:

- Zoom Webinars: $79.00 per month for up to 500 attendees
- Zoom Sessions: $99.00 per month
- Zoom Events: $149.00 per month

In contrast, Teams includes webinar capabilities in its Business Standard plan without extra charges.

When it comes to AI features, Zoom includes its AI Companion with all paid plans at no additional cost. Teams, however, requires the Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on, priced at $30.00 per user per month, to access AI functionalities.

For small businesses, the decision often hinges on existing software ecosystems. Teams offers strong value through its integration with the Microsoft 365 suite, while Zoom's straightforward pricing appeals to organizations focused on high-quality video conferencing.

Dan Stine from Lake|Flato Architects shared his perspective:

> "Zoom was cheaper than Teams, which is one of the reasons we switched away from Microsoft Teams Phones to Zoom Phones. But more importantly, when you're consolidated on Zoom, your Zoom Phone won't ring when you're in a meeting. It knows that you're busy so the phone won't disrupt you."

These pricing options highlight the platforms' distinct approaches: Zoom prioritizes premium video conferencing at competitive rates, while Teams leverages its Microsoft ecosystem to deliver a broad collaboration toolkit tailored to diverse business needs.

## Security and Compliance

When choosing the right platform, security is always a top priority. With cyberattacks happening every 39 seconds and breaches costing an average of $4.35 million, it's clear why strong security measures are non-negotiable. Both platforms offer robust encryption and compliance features, but their approaches differ in key ways.

### Data Protection and Encryption

Both **Microsoft Teams** and **Zoom** emphasize data protection, but they implement it differently.

**Microsoft Teams** uses industry-standard protocols like TLS and SRTP to encrypt data both in transit and at rest. For one-on-one calls, Teams provides end-to-end encryption (E2EE), ensuring only the participants can access the conversation. Authentication is handled through Microsoft Entra ID, which also manages message integrity. Teams supports two-factor authentication (2FA) across the platform and offers single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for added convenience and security.

> "As a customer of Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you own and control your data. Microsoft doesn't use your data for anything other than providing you with the service you subscribed to." – Microsoft

**Zoom**, on the other hand, employs AES 256-bit GCM encryption to secure data in transit. It also offers a Customer Managed Key (CMK) feature, enabling businesses to control their own encryption keys. In February 2025, Zoom enhanced its encryption capabilities by partnering with Thales, integrating Thales' CipherTrust Cloud Key Management (CCKM) to allow independent encryption key management across multi-cloud environments. While Zoom does provide end-to-end encryption, it's available as a premium feature rather than a standard one.

### Compliance Standards

Encryption is just one piece of the puzzle - compliance with global standards is equally critical.

**Microsoft Teams** meets Tier D compliance requirements, adhering to standards like HIPAA, ISO 27001, ISO 27018, SSAE16 SOC 1 and SOC 2, and the EU Model Clauses (EUMC). It integrates with Microsoft Purview tools to ensure communication compliance, enforce retention policies, prevent data loss, and support eDiscovery. For healthcare organizations, Teams can be configured to meet HIPAA requirements, though this requires specific setups, such as using Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 or E5 accounts for secure telehealth services.

**Zoom** has its own set of compliance certifications and attestations to demonstrate its commitment to security and privacy. It offers a HIPAA-compliant plan that includes a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). For healthcare settings, Zoom provides a dedicated "Zoom for Healthcare" solution, which requires organizations to establish a BAA, disable recordings, enable waiting rooms, use passwords, and configure screen sharing permissions properly. Additionally, Zoom's SOC 2 + HITRUST report offers transparency into the measures protecting its platform.

Both platforms also support multi-factor authentication (MFA), which can reduce the risk of account compromise by 99.22%. Notably, Microsoft has made MFA mandatory for admin center access.

For organizations managing sensitive data, the choice between Teams and Zoom often comes down to existing systems and specific compliance needs. Teams integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365 environments, while Zoom offers more flexibility with encryption key management and tailored solutions for certain industries.

## Best Use Cases

Choosing between Zoom and Teams isn't just about features - it's about aligning the platform with your specific needs. What works for a Fortune 500 company might be too complex for a small startup, and the right tool for internal team meetings might not be the best fit for client presentations.

### Small Business vs. Large Organizations

Small businesses often need simple, budget-friendly tools that require minimal technical setup. For these companies, **Zoom** stands out as an easy-to-use option. As one Gartner Peer Insights reviewer put it:

> "Zoom is incredibly easy to use, with a simple interface that allows even those with minimal technical experience to quickly set up and join meetings"

This simplicity is a game-changer when IT resources are limited, making it easier for employees to adopt without extensive training. While Microsoft Teams Essentials offers lower pricing, it demands more technical setup and works best when paired with other Microsoft services.

Adoption trends back this up. As of 2024, only **21% of small businesses** use Microsoft Teams for workplace communication, compared to **47% of mid-sized businesses**. This suggests that as companies grow and face more complex needs, they lean toward Teams for its broader collaboration capabilities.

On the other hand, **91% of Fortune 100 companies** rely on Microsoft Teams, showcasing its dominance in enterprise environments. Teams' integration with Microsoft 365 and its robust administrative controls make it ideal for large organizations managing intricate workflows. One user from a large organization shared:

> "Microsoft Teams is by far the most stable, dependable, flexible meeting platform that I personally have used and this is why it is what our agency uses for all of our client meetings and the vast majority of our internal meetings. For our clients, Teams is easy, trustworthy, and reliable"

For large companies, the ability to customize workflows, integrate with enterprise software, and manage user permissions is critical - and Teams excels in these areas.

### Remote Work and Team Collaboration

The shift to remote work has further highlighted the differences between these platforms. Success today isn't just about hosting meetings; it's about fostering collaboration and maintaining team cohesion, even when team members are spread across time zones.

**Zoom** is particularly effective for external communication, such as client meetings, sales calls, and cross-company collaborations. Its ease of use ensures that clients can join meetings without needing specific software or accounts. For asynchronous work, Zoom offers tools like Zoom Clips, which allow teams to collaborate without needing to meet live. As Matthieu, a Product Manager, explained:

> "With Clips, we can collaborate asynchronously over video. I find it's the best tool for demonstration"

Laura, a Content Designer, added:

> "Clips isn't a meeting replacement but more of an accompaniment to keep momentum going"

The growing reliance on asynchronous communication is evident, with regular note sharing and status updates becoming common practices among remote teams.

**Microsoft Teams**, on the other hand, is built for creating a persistent digital workspace. Unlike Zoom's meeting-first approach, Teams offers ongoing collaboration spaces where conversations, files, and projects are all integrated. This setup is particularly valuable for internal teams where maintaining context and history is essential.

Teams' chat functionality highlights this strength. While Zoom offers basic chat tied to meetings, Teams provides individual chats, group chats, channel-based conversations, and access to chat history - whether inside or outside of meetings. This creates a more seamless experience for remote teams working on long-term projects.

However, remote work tools aren't without challenges. **75% of employees believe their organization's current remote work technology needs improvement**. This shows the importance of regularly evaluating and upgrading tools, regardless of the platform chosen.

Ultimately, the success of remote collaboration often depends on how the tools are implemented. **67% of businesses retain employees best when flexible hours are offered**. Platforms must support asynchronous work patterns to keep teams connected across time zones. Both Zoom and Teams offer features like AI-powered meeting summaries and scheduled message delivery, but Teams' persistent workspace model often provides better continuity for ongoing projects.

For businesses focused on external communication and straightforward video calls, Zoom's simplicity is a strong advantage. For teams that need a comprehensive collaboration hub with seamless integration into document and project management systems, Teams delivers more value.

## Final Recommendations

Deciding between Zoom and Microsoft Teams boils down to your communication needs and the tools your organization already uses.

### Summary of Strengths and Weaknesses

Looking back at the comparisons, it's clear that each platform brings its own set of strengths and challenges to the table.

**Zoom stands out for its video quality, user-friendly interface, and affordability.** One TrustRadius customer shared their experience:
