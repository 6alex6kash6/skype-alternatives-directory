## Why People Leave MagicJack

MagicJack gained popularity through late-night infomercials promising cheap home phone service, but many users are discovering its limitations. After waiting to talk to customer service and after going through all detailed verification process, they request to speak to the person whose name on the account only not any one else, making support frustratingly inaccessible.

The most common complaints include:

- **Poor Customer Service**: By far the number one complaint is based around poor customer service. Historically they did not provide a customer service phone number for people having issues to call. Users report chat-only support with long wait times and unhelpful responses.

- **Hardware Failures**: I had MagicJack for over 5 years. Last year connectivity issues caused calls to disconnect after roughly 5 minutes, and frequently the phone wouldn't ring with incoming calls. Device replacements cost around $40 with no warranty on replacements.

- **Call Quality Issues**: MagicJack simply does not work. The people you call can't hear you, the Contacts only catch the last few numbers when dialing, and you can't enter in menu numbers when you do get through

- **Hidden Costs**: While advertised as cheap, users face unexpected E911 fees ($19.80/year), regulatory fees, and no refunds on prepaid years if the device fails.

- **Limited Features**: No call recording, shared numbers, or business integrations that modern alternatives offer.

## Top MagicJack Alternatives

### 1. Yolla - Best for International Calling

Perfect for those who primarily need affordable international calls.

Great for calling landlines and mobiles worldwide without the recipient needing internet.

## How to Switch

### 1. Choose Your Alternative
Consider your needs: international calling (Yolla/Talk360), home replacement (Ooma), or business features (OpenPhone/MightyCall/RingCentral).

### 2. Port Your Number
Most providers offer number porting for $10-20. The porting process will likely take anywhere from two to five days. Contact your new provider first to initiate the process.

### 3. Set Your End Date
After you've decided on an alternative, the first thing you should do is notify magicJack and decide on a date for the service to end. Time this with your new service activation.

### 4. Test Before Canceling
Most alternatives offer free trials. Test call quality and features before fully switching to avoid service interruption.

Remember: MagicJack won't refund unused service time, so plan your switch accordingly. With better alternatives available at competitive prices, you can upgrade your calling experience without breaking the bank.
