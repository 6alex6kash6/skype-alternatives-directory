# Why People Leave 8x8

8x8 positioned itself as an all-in-one unified communications platform, but many businesses are discovering its significant limitations. This from customers reviews "This company has a bad issue with their platform where the phone lines keep on dropping off. Tech support is a bunch of kids in the Philippines who have very little knowledge and can't help it all".

The most common complaints from real users include:

- **Poor Customer Support**: For two years, not one 8x8 representative informed our client about key settings like enabling HD Voice (G.722 codec), which could have drastically improved call quality. Users report extremely long wait times and unhelpful offshore support teams.

- **Technical Problems**: If you need support, expect long hold times (30 minutes +) and to have to start running the gauntlet at the base level of support. The softphone app constantly crashes and interferes with other programs.

- **Hidden Pricing**: 8×8 no longer lists their prices, their last published plans cost between $24-185 per user/per month, forcing businesses to contact sales for quotes.

- **Call Quality Issues**: We recently switched to 8x8 from another phone system that was working perfectly for years, and so far our experience has been less than desirable. Users report dropped calls, one-way audio, and connectivity problems.

- **Contract Traps**: If I could give zero or negative stars I would. This company is as shady as it gets. I have requested to cancel now 4 times. Many struggle with cancellation and continue being charged.

## How to Switch

### 1. Document Your Current Setup
Before leaving 8x8, document your call flows, IVR menus, user extensions, and any custom configurations. This will make recreation easier in your new system.

### 2. Choose Based on Your Needs
- Need extensive integrations? → RingCentral
- Want transparent pricing? → Nextiva  
- Running a call center? → CloudTalk
- Small team on a budget? → OpenPhone or Ooma

### 3. Plan Your Migration
The VoIP solution has a huge selection of training features, like call monitoring and call whisper. Most alternatives offer free trials and migration support. Schedule your switch during low-call-volume periods.

### 4. Port Your Numbers
Most providers handle number porting for free or a small fee ($10-20). Start this process early as it can take 5-10 business days. Have your 8x8 account information ready.

Remember: Unlike 8x8's unclear cancellation policies, most alternatives offer month-to-month options without long-term contracts. Test thoroughly during free trials before committing to ensure the solution meets your needs.
