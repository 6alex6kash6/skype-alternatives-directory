    content: "I have no choice but to use Line, because it is the default app for almost everything in Taiwan: employers, universities, friends. I can say from being forced to use it for five years that it is the worst single piece of software I've ever used, in terms of design, stability, usability, customer service, pricing, and basically anything else you could evaluate an app on. \n\nFor years I've hated the interface and how difficult (or sometimes impossible) it is to use the same account on multiple devices, how chats need to be manually backed up and are extremely difficult to transfer between mobile and PC. I've hated the extortionate prices of stickers and how once free stickers switch to being paid products. \n\nBut in the last month, the app has actually seriously impacted my life. When my old phone went dead suddenly, I was completely unable to transfer my account to my new phone, because I was sent in a loop that required me to use my old, bricked phone to verify my login. I jumped through hoops for days before getting back access to my account, all the while unable to see messages from my employer and teachers. Those messages aren't backed up on the cloud, so I had to check with everyone what if anything they sent me during that time. \n\nIt somehow got worse when I discovered someone (presumably a scammer) made an account using a different phone number of mine (not the one my actual line account is registered to. This is actually a very common issue in Taiwan and a key method scammers use. But after over a month of sending messages back and forth between online customer service, who didn't understand my problem no matter what language I used, I'm still stuck with someone using my phone number illegally and no solution.\n\nI would love to just delete Line and never use it again, but life doesn't allow it. Please, Taiwan: stop using Line, at least for important information. That's what email is for.",

    content: "Signed up for line as I needed it for my Taiwan trip since it is the preferred messenger service over there. I literally only used the app once to send a single message (which never arrived), and one month later I was blocked from accessing my account. After contacting customer service I was told I violated guidelines and that they would not help me any further. I don’t even have the option to create a new account since I have to verify it with the same apple ID that is linked to my existing account. Terrible app and worst customer experience I ever encountered!!! I don’t understand how this app is preferred over the many way better experiences out there! ",

    content: "My credit card, used in Line Pay, started showing numerous charges from a merchant named \"(!(<...\" Food Business, Taipei, along with the transaction amounts. I called my credit card company, but they couldn't provide more information. This led me to cancel my credit card twice, dealing with all the associated issues.\n\nInitially, I thought my phone had been hacked. Then, I stumbled upon an article in the Line Help Center mentioning that sometimes Line charges appear with names like \"(!(<...\". This prompted me to match these charges against my credit card transactions.\n\nI spent countless hours with ZERO help from Line Pay. It turned out that the \"secret\" merchant was actually LINE. Unbelievably, the developers at Line don't seem to know how to correctly interface with the credit card company. To \"patch\" this incompetence, they buried a four-word explanation in their FAQ.\n\nI wish I could fix bugs by simply adding info to an FAQ and consider it an acceptable solution. I would replace the entire interface team with more competent developers. It seems they still don't realize they have a bug.",
