    title: "Magicjack is magic at STEALING your money.",
    content: "Magicjack is magic at STEALING your money.  FRADULENT MISREPRESENTATION at its best.  After years with them I have had to buy 4  of their faulty plugins and the last one seemd fine for 2 years till i did the 3 year payment instead of just yearly payment. The day after paying $177 proof> (-$177.35 MAGICJACK OPOS 118.81 MAGICJACK.COM561-5 Details Transaction date Feb 3, 2025 )IT STOPPED WORKING  go figure (which I had a niggeling feeling this might happen). Afterwards talked to several others in our town who had the same problem ****so watch out paying in advance. I tried to fix it with their \"customer service \" thru email as you cant call like they tell you to do if its not working ...and got the same messages umpteen times as to how to fix it which doesnt work ,as well as them saying to BUY A NEW ONE..THE CROOKS to top it off I had to go buy a cell phone now at $30 a month freedom mobile yippie it works flip phone 5 g compatible 45 for the phone which comes off your bill and this month if you use a debit or visa they take 5 a month off right now si 25 a mth not 30( i am a senior who didnt want a phone with all the crap on it too confusing time consuming and cant see the tiny icons anyway so got the cheapeast one going as I only get/ have 4 calls a month if that  one friend)... sickening to even have to pay any amount for that...but called them to cancel my service as by now I KNEW an email would do zipp (they know that too) for $177 then the billing woman said I COULDNT BE REFUNDED !!! boy or boy she got an ear full then i said ok fraud department at the bank will deal with it then she got rude talked over me loudly and huffy they will send to the \"escalation team\" omg sounds like temu and shein and ebay this is $177 not a $10 item...she said i will hear their decission within 3-5 business days by EMAIL..of course and of course easter weekend.  Its only day 2 but i KNOW what their fradulent team will email some stock email they sent everyone on here and other sites Ive seen since this rip off! They have the emails of all the times i emailed them since paying so the phone hasnt worked but we shall see...last resort wait 14 days  call the bank fraud dept and get it fully refunded...which i shouldnt have to do...(whilst they use my money getting interest in the bank with 100\"s of thousands probably millions of people they ripped off) SICKENING and  what a COLOSSAL SCAM but i am sure they will be defunk soon due to  a class action lawsuit for illiegal theft of monies fraud missrepresentation plus to the digital ID coming upon us(as they well know rgo all the stealing of peoples hard earned monies) so they will be claiming bankrupsy at our the customers expense. BOTTOM LINE DONT BOTHER ITS A RIP OFF AND IF YOUR NOT AN IT TECH YOU WILL LOOSE. Some chinese co should change it slightly to work better (so no copywrite infringement) mass produce the guts of magicjack or just do it thru your email or online sell for $15 complete a yr as an add on to your email make a fortune,,,then too if it breaks down we wont care as much as you would use it a a back up.",

    content: "They are huge scammers and once they have your credit card it's almost impossible to stop them from charging you.  They have procedures and policies in place to delay, delay, delay and make it super difficult to ever cancel your account.  Thieves!  Even logging onto their website (log into your account) and there is no place to cancel.  They also auto renew by sending you can email that they are going to do it, but then it's impossible to reach them to stop the charge.  Once they already charge you, they simply use that email (which is often sent to spam) as proof that you somehow approved the charge.  When I did finally get someone on the phone, they said I had to wait 3 days for them to \"review\" my account to see if they would approve the refund or not.  They said wait for an email.  Then I asked them to cancel my account and delete my credit card from your records. They refused to delete my credit card, said it was impossible, and said since I requested a refund for a charge that auto renewed just 4 days ago, that if they canceled my account I would not get a refund.  All they give is excuses and use circular arguments.",

I've been with MagicJack almost 20 years and only in the beginning did I have a ball. I feel I have been exploited by their new Microsoft aquaintance of the name. It's a shame for all the poorer people to be enslaved to the new MagicJack buisiness; they don't even exist and we're throwing our money out the window to them.. What a rip off..!!!",

And of course I could not get a refund even though I didn’t not use the service at all (since I was not able to). No empathy from anyone on their team and just terrible customer service overall.

This fee isnt listed on the renewal web page that we are forced to use in order to renew the service.   I paid to renew twice, MAgicJack disabled the phone and in order to fix their error, I need to phone them.\n\nCompany is horrible to get a hold of, has awful or non-existent service and charges annual fees that they make up as they go.",

    title: "Do yourself a favor and run!",
    content: "Do yourself a favor and run! Years ago I had a magic jack and it was great. My parents recently moved out of state to live with my sister after my Dad had a stroke. I wanted to be able to talk to them and have them call me (as my sister has no phone in the house) so I immediately thought Magic Jack. What a big mistake. I ordered the device and paid for the one year subscription. The device was missing upon delivery. Somehow in the shipping process, the box got torn open and the device and everything else with it went missing. The post office, instead of returning the empty box to Magic jack, proceeded to deliver the empty box in a plastic bag offering an apology. When I called Magic jack they dutifully read me a section in their contract that says the buyer is responsible, not Magic Jack if the unit is not delivered or damaged during delivery. Isn’t that wonderful! We tried to find out if the package was insured, but in the multiple phone calls we made, no one would answer our question. I guess after reading all the reviews, this may have been a blessing in disguise. According to those that did receive their device, service was poor and Magic jack put them on auto payment and these folks are having one heck of a time getting it cancelled.",

    content: "These are charlatans.  Since I bought this useless piece of crap (in Canada it is almost 50 dollars) I had to purchase two ten-dollars credits to make long distance calls.  Each time they added another 4 dollars as \"service charge\".  So the price of calls is a lot higher (40%) than the advertised price.\nMore importantly, in total I have been able to make less than 3 minutes of useful calls.\n\nThere are multiple problems:\n1) Half the time the number you dial sends you to a wrong country and wrong number.  \n2) Sound quality even in the wrong country is awful.\n3) In the last 12 tries, every time I call the voice from the other side kept on repeating.  For example the other side says \"Hi how are you?\"  then you keep on hearing \"Hi how are you?\"\"Hi how are you?\"\"Hi how are you?\"\"Hi how are you?\" This repeats till you have to hang up and many minutes are deducted from your purchased credit.\n4) They have 0 tech support and customer service.  Try calling them.  It gets disconnected or recorded message tells you to send them an email or worse, it says that \"they are too busy, call later\" and hangs up on you.  \nIt is a complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY IT.  They are dishonest, have absolutely no support or customer service.  You might as well burn your money and be less frustrated.  \nTheir business model is stealing little money from a lot of people everyday.  They think nobody can afford to take them to court over a few dollars.  That is how they have stayed in business so long.\n\nUPDATE:\nI send them an email explaining the problem with repeating voices in very clear details.  Two days later I got a generic answer back asking me to explain the problem!  This is a dishonest tactic to divert the responsibility and action by asking the victim for the next step, instead of taking any action or solving the problem,   That email had nothing to do with my problem and was probably written by some crook just to bounce back a complaint.  It will be emailed to anyone who had a problem, just to say they are doing something while not providing a solution. \n \nI could not possibly be the only one with this experience, they must have heard this complaint hundreds or thousands of times before.\n\nI WILL NEVER PAY THESE CHARLATANS A PENNY ANY MORE OR RENEW, AND REGRET WASTING 70 DOLLARS ON A USELESS JUNK.\n\nI am sorry I have to give them 1 star.  There is no option for ZERO star.",

    content: "I took advantage of a special deal to extend my Magic Jack service for 2 years just before switching Internet Service from Shaw to Telus.  My service was not due to expire until a month or so later.  Once my ISP was switched over, I found the MagicJack home VOIP device stopped working.  Telus support couldn't help and MagicJack tech support would not even look at the problem before I faxed them a notarized statement that my wife had died as she was the one who set up the account initially.  Getting that notarized statement would cost me as much as the renewal of my MJ service, so I asked for my money back just for that renewal, being prepared to lose the remaining time on my not yet expired service.  All I got from them was \"we don't give refunds\".  Basically, they stole $107 from me and refuse to refund it.  I tried to get the charge reversed via the complaints department of my credit card provider (Banner Bank) but they sided with MagicJack after I was unable to fax them documentation which did not exist because everything was done online through MagicJack's website.  Evidently this company is not above stealing from their customers, so I would recommend avoiding them.  After I got the news from Banner Bank, I searched online for similar experiences and found that others had the same problem with Telus not allowing MagicJack hardware to connect to the internet through them. No one had a solution.   I've since donated my collection of cordless land line phones and rely on my cell phone service from Telus as my only phone.   So I guess this review reflects badly on Banner Bank credit card service and Telus internet as well.",
