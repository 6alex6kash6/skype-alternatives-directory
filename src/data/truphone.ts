I have followed all the instructions watch the video and tried for over two hours, sending multiple screenshots to customer service, who did not help the outcome. When entering the required information manually, the Apple phone asked for a confirmation number. Which I don’t have and they don’t have the iPhone says to contact your carrier. I can’t contact my carrier because I’m in another country. What a mess.",

      "Appalling customer service! Forced to use Truphone on family share Apple Watch. Bought prepaid annual plan which would not activate, wasted a week on back and forth emails with customer service (they kept closing the ticket without resolving the issue). After 3 months the Apple Watch stopped working and was replaced, and can’t get the plan to transfer to new watch. Have had zero response from customer “service” other than to send me a “simple link” which naturally didn’t work! SORT OUT THIS PRoBLEM WITH YOUR PRODUCT , TRUPHONE! PLEASE RESPOND",

I cancelled all services with them in September 2022 and they continued to take funds from my account right through to March 2023. I have been trying for 2 months to get them to refund and they just take you in circles and won’t pay the money back. Terrible company to deal with!",

The customer service team has helped me with a couple of issues I had and resolved all of my issues. I'd recommend Truphone vs. alternatives like Airalo. The service is better and it's easy to manage. \n\nIf you're travelling the world, Truphone is a great solution to accessing the internet wherever you are and I will continue using it as we continue our way through South America. \n\nThank you Truphone!",
