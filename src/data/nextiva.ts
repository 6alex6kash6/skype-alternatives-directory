      "We signed up for Nextiva expecting a straightforward business-phone solution. Instead, we spent seven mind-numbing days chasing their ever-shifting demands—forms, legal boilerplate, and contradictory “compliance” rules they can’t even explain. Each support ticket spawned a new hurdle, grinding our rollout to a halt while our other vendors sailed through approval in hours.\n\nEndless Red Tape: They insisted on SMS disclosures we don’t legally need—and then changed their requirements mid-process.\n\nSlow, Disconnected Support: Every “specialist” handed us off to someone else; no one read the previous notes, so we repeated the same story on loop.\n\nProductivity Black Hole: We lost a full workweek, delayed client calls, and burned staff hours just trying to get a phone number activated.\n\nIf you value your time (and sanity), steer clear of Nextiva. We’ve already moved on to a competing provider that did in one afternoon what Nextiva couldn’t handle in seven days of excuses.",
