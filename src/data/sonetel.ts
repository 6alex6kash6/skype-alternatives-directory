      "Started with Sonotel 5 years ago, it was a reasonable service. However I have had nothing but trouble in the last 12 months. Numbers not connecting overseas, and customers now complaining because the local number that i use to divert to my mobile is disconnected. I recently paid to top up the account and a week later got an email saying they haven't received any payment and my number has been withdrawn today.I double checked and yes the payment was made and my account is in credit. So what can one do ???\nI am looking around for a reliable service, Any suggestions ????\n",

      "At first, I was quite pleased with the service—your team was quick to respond, and the documents were verified in a short time. However, after the number was activated and I added funds to enable the calling feature, I noticed that the number is not functioning as expected. It is neither receiving nor making calls, although the voicemail appears to be working.\n\nI have raised this issue multiple times over the past four days but, unfortunately, have not received any response. It has now been seven days since the number was activated, yet it remains unusable.\n\nI fully understand the current high volume of customer requests, but issues like this—especially for business use—should be treated with high priority. Reliable communication is essential for our operations, and this delay is significantly affecting our workflow.\n\nI sincerely hope this matter is resolved quickly, as continued delays and lack of communication can harm the trust and reputation your service has built.",

      "Similar to what I and others i know and work with, the end of Skype as we know it had some very stressful effects that we had to solve.   I had been using Skype primarily for business for many years and never anticipated this.  Fortunately I found a good solution with Sonetel which allowed me to move forward.  Thankfully the Sonetelsolution was going through dramatic changes due to the volume of ex skype users so I wasnt along.  I'm not the most patient person but Sonetel responded to all my questions quickly and every customer service/support person I worked with was invaluable.",

All my banking is on this address, also my IRS documentation, but Sonetel rejected it. I filed a case and received a case number, I replied to the case number and received a case number for the previous case number. I suggest Henrik Thomé takes his Sonetel more serious, or just go back to his filming. Sonetel is probably not a scam, but as a tech company borderline ridiculous.  \n\nI have now requested a refund let's see how that goes. ",
