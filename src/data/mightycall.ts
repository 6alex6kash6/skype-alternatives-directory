    title: "I’ve been with Mightycall for a couple weeks now and I am not impressed.",
    content: "First of all, they bill themselves as Call Center software, and though they allow you to have many phone lines (and you can “label” them to identify them easily for human readability in their online dashboard), you cannot actually see the phone line or the label for the phone line on incoming calls in many use cases!\n\nWhat I mean by a label is lets say you have a number ending in .9999 to act as a phone line for Technical Support.  You have another number ending in .7777 to act as a phone line for Sales.  I can give those numbers labels that are “Technical Support” and “Sales”.  Or if I handled calls for both Target and Walmart, I could label a phone line \"Target\" and another phone line could be labeled \"Walmart\".\n\nThough you can see labels for those numbers in a lot of administrative tasks, for actual incoming calls, in most use cases (mobile phone app, softphone desktop app, web browser UI) you CANNOT see what phone line the incoming calls are coming in on or the “label” (Sales or Technical Support).  It’s crazy how they don’t have that basic functionality.  You can have 8 phone lines, and you have no idea what phone line a client is calling in on.\n\nThe only functionality regarding labeling that I’ve been able to confirm is for the desktop application and web browser, if the window is MINIMIZED, you will get a windows notification for a few seconds that shows the incoming phone line and label of it being called.  But only for a few seconds.   If you actually look at the application on your PC, or if the application was already active/had focus when the call comes in, all you see in the UI is the caller ID – no indication of what phone line is being called.  You have no idea how to greet the customer or what they’re calling about.  So, the only way you know what line is being called on your PC, is if your application is MINIMIZED/NOT ACTIVE, and you only see it for a few seconds.\n\nTheir support rep confirmed that they do NOT support at all the labeling of the phone line being called on the iOS app.  They claimed that it’s on the “To-Do” list, but it’s such a simple thing to do I don’t believe them – why is that not implemented already?\n\nThe Android application is what I’m trying to use on my phone, but I can’t get it to work properly.  Their support sent me a screenshot which they claimed is what the Android app shows when a call comes in and shows the label of the phone line being called, but I’ve never seen that screen myself, and attempts to schedule a training session with their sales team, both via email and their “online calendar booking” are ignored.  Even if I book a calendar appointment on their website (“Free White Glove Setup” the site says – yeah right!) they literally don’t even show up to the scheduled Zoom meeting.  Totally negligent.  And they don’t respond to my manual email request to do a videoconference with someone knowledgeable on how the android app works.\n\nEven their support team will fail to respond to your inquiries half the time it seems.  They completely ignored my most important support email as my first questions as a new customer, and it wasn’t until I followed up asking “Can I get a reply please” a few days later that they responded finally.   Also, with further questions about how can I see what phone line a customer is calling on, a support rep sent me a screenshot supposedly from the desktop app claiming you could see the phone line label for an active call, but when I replied back “My screen doesn’t quite look like that, what do I need to do or where do I go in the dashboard to see what you’ve screenshotted”, they ghosted me.  And even their screenshot was showing some tiny weird element on the screen that is completely separate and far away from the \"softphone\" UI where you actually answer the call.\n\nLack of care with helping customers seems to be MightyCall’s forte.\n\nThey also don’t let you buy voicemail boxes – if you want more voicemailboxes than you have users, you have to pay for a FULL user to get another voicemail box.  So prepare to pay literal multiple hundreds of dollars per year just for an additional voicemail box in that scenario.\n\nAlso, checking multiple voicemail boxes is pretty strange/convoluted.  It does technically work, but it’s weird – I won’t get into the details because it won’t really make sense when verbalized.  Let’s just say MightyCall should have a dedicated Voicemail tab or something like that, yet they don't.\n\nThe only positives I have had with them so far are:\n\n1)\tFast number port processing\n2)\tCertain administrative tasks are pretty easy to configure.\n\nIf they continue at this rate, I don’t think I’ll be staying with them.\n\nIf they ever get phone line labeling working properly on both iOS and Android apps, AND the desktop application, I’ll update this review.",

Not a single legitimate call was ever received but the business was legally required to maintain a phone number.\n\nAfter receiving no communication from MightyCall between 2021 and 2024, the cost of this plan was suddenly jacked up to over $600 per year, with a temporary \"legacy\" discount of roughly $300. \n\nPer their \"Terms of Service\" they do not offer refunds of portions of unused subscriptions, even if you received no calls and cancel within the first week of a new year.\n\nThey also do not let you cancel directly through their website, forcing you to wait for a call from one of their reps at their convenience. (This actually turned out to be an email, but as I now am only awake at night I had to stay awake for 48 hours straight waiting for a call.)\n\nAm now having to fight with my bank to get the charges reversed.\n\nDon't use this company if you expect consistent pricing or basic levels of communication. I've worked with health clubs that had better cancellation policies and we all know how awful they are!",
