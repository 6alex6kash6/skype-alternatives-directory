I get a real person, the same day and usually they give me extra minutes or something else just to make sure I'm happy. They tell me what to do to fix it and OMG, IT WORKS! Shocking, i know! AND NO, I CAN'T GET CODES, IT'S A VOIP, BUT I ALSO HAVE COMPLETE PRIVACY, it's untraceable, and the price is so high it's $0 a month! Z-E-R-O dollars and no cents is expensive,.....NOT!
