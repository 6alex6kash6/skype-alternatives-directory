      "Wish I had read reviews of this company before our church signed up for a contract. Technical support is non-existent, the billing system is horrible and they billed for the wrong number of licenses for months. They refuse to credit billing for equipment that was returned because their \"distribution center\" claims the packaging was damaged (they provided the RMA and insured shipping label for their shipper of choice), yet they can't provide ANY documentation to support the charges to me. I won't be renewing at the end of our term. Hopefully the problems I see others having with canceling service won't be an issue. ",

      "I am blown away by the blatant thievery from goto, i switched services in January after 5 years with goto with no issues, it took weeks with many delays to port my number to my new service. Instead of trying to win my business back, the charged me for another month. I disputed with the customer service team and eventually gave up, but then I was charged again in February, and March. So i decided to make sure to get email proof, which I have, that my account was cancelled, and I will not be charged again. It's now April and not only was I charged, but I was charged twice!!!!! This is unbelievable, and the absolute worst attempt at customer retention I have ever seen. \n\nI am now happily with another service (dialpad) at a fraction of the cost, i paid $130 for the year as opposed to goto's $65 per month!!! for a better service, a better product, with better customer service.\n\nAvoid goto at all costs, never mind a 1-star review, they should be shut down and persecuted.",

      'Today, one of our departments received an unsolicited call from a so-called GoTo Connect "representative". She deceitfully claimed she was "following up on a recent conversation with the IT department" — a conversation that never happened.\n\nAs the Managing Systems Administrator, I’m well aware of our business contacts. Although I didn’t recognize the name or company, I accepted the call — we are a team of four, after all, and I wanted to be sure. It quickly became clear that the caller had never spoken to anyone here. Her goal was simple: deceive her way past the front line.\n\nAnd it gets worse.\n\nOur phone system presents external callers with a menu of six department options. Instead of honestly contacting reception, Janet deliberately pressed 2 — Travel — presumably hoping that department wouldn’t verify her story and would simply patch her through. She deliberately avoided reception, likely because she knew she’d be vetted. This wasn’t a misunderstanding; it was a calculated and dishonest tactic.\n\nFrankly, I have zero interest in whatever product GoTo Connect claims to offer. As I told their representative, any company that resorts to deception as a standard sales tactic instantly disqualifies itself from serious consideration. Trust, transparency, and respect are the baseline expectations, GoTo Connect shattered them before even introducing themselves properly.\n\nShame on you, GoTo Connect. Your practices are not only unprofessional — they are an embarrassment to your brand.',

      "I can't speak to the quality of the product, however, the customer service and business ethics of the company are sketchy at best. We had an annual subscription that auto renewed on us without prior notification. When the invoice came we notified the company that we no longer needed the service and would like to cancel the subscription. Technically and according to the contract, we needed to notify the prior to the end of the annual subscription of our desire to terminate the contract. We acknowledged that we had missed that deadline and offered to pay the prorated amount for the time that had gone over the previous contract, but they have refused and are requiring that we pay for the full one year subscription that will go complete unused. While they are technically within their rights to do this according to their terms, this does show a complete lack of business ethics and integrity. We we not use their services again and would advise others against using their services.",

    content:
      "We used LogmeinPro for years and Logmein before that.  We renewed our subscription in October 2024, but sold the business shortly after that in November.\n\nWhen we called for a prorated refund for the remainder of the term, we were told that it is the company's written policy to fulfill the contract for the remainder of the subscription period, despite the fact that there was no business left to service!\n\nWe ran a multimillion dollar successful small business for 30 years before selling it, and our motto was the customer is always right.  My managerial and customer service staff was told that sometimes you make decisions that are right for the customer and right for the business, even if those decisions don't fall within your written guidelines.  \n\nWhat a stupid, myopic business decision to not refund the unused portion of a service when a customer's business no longer exists.  When a customer sells a business, and obviously no longer \nhas a need for the service, this should be an exception to the rules.  A supervisor should be empowered and have the option to make an exception in a case like this, as a gesture of goodwill and good business sense and ethics.  Isn't this what is taught in Management 101?  Come on GoTo! \n\nIn addition, I was kept on the line for half an hour while our account was being verified, only for the CSR to tell me that the company's policy is no refunds, period.  He could have explained that at the very beginning of the call, as I stated my reason for calling immediately...which added insult to injury.  Believe it or not, after all this, the CSR then asked if I wanted to cancel the automatic subscription renewal for succeeding years, for our company that no longer existed.  What???\n\n    I am writing this review to tell any prospective customers to stay miles away from this company.  If they treat a long-time customer this way, what other business un-friendly policies might they have.  Terrible, terrible disrespectful business decision for a customer of over 20 years.  For the sake of a few hundred dollars, this policy now stands to lose them thousands of dollars as the word gets out. Would you work for or use a company that treats their best, long-term customers like this?",

GOTO Support told me GOTO has "no record of any GOTO billings to me" and that "someone else" pretending to be GOTO was billing me.  That I should cancel that particular credit card.\n\nFew days later I receive an email from GOTO Support. This email informs me that GOTO records show that the GOTO was subscription cancelled Oct 2024, but that GOTO has no record of billing me. Interesting.\n\nI called my credit card\'s bank to ask the bank to cancel my credit card and to register a complaint about GOTO\'s 4 months of after cancellation monthly charges.\n\nMost recently, GOTO Support sent me an email informing me that with regards to my complaint about GOTO monthly charges that all GOTO billings are "final".  Lastly, that if I need further assistant to respond to GOTO Support\'s email.\n\nIn short, GOTO monthly subscription billing are final even after GOTO subscription cancellation.  \n\n',
