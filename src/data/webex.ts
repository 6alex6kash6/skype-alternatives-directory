You can't talk to anyone , they have a vendor Virtual Guardians LLC , who is unprofessional and who caused my business to lose business and put me at risk from being sued- I am a physician and their vendor shut my phone off without notice for \"non payment\" when payments are made automatically through the bank and he stopped cashing my checks then he shut me off without notice just after the July 4th weekend , when we returned from holiday our phones were off. He could have called me on webex chat or emailed me or sent me a letter but did none of this and shut me off.  Webex when I complained told me i had to pay the bill first before they will move me to another vedor. ",

It was stressful, embarrassing and extremely frustrating. It was never resolved because I couldn't get hold of the company to raise a case, get to the bottom of it or make a complaint. I kept getting taken through loads of systems I had to sign up for (Webex, then Cisco, then something else) and pages that wouldn't load so I gave up in the end. I have raised the matter with the training provider and recommended considering using another video call provider. \n I've never had this problem with any other system. It became my problem and created extra stress and work for me. The fact that I had to miss out on training because of Webex's incompetence is not fair on me.",

It took ages to find out how to access contacts on my Mac and some boxes, where, logically you would begin to type the name, just would not access the contacts while a totally unrelated one at the top of the screen did.

So you need to input email addresses directly there to be able to invite people.\n\nGreat work making this a big time waster everytime we need to do a meeting. I still have a few customers using webex only sadly, but everybody else moved to Zoom for these reasons. Webex used to be a tool for support to help customers, now it s barely a tool to set up voicecalls.\n\nLiterally 5 minutes after leaving this review I started a session - cant even see the chat at all, cant take or request control. issue apparently known as per multiple forums on the net.\nWell, this is enough. I am deleting webex client from my computer as it is worse than useless.\n\n[update]\nPeak inefficiency has been reached. The interface is now completely full of buttons and submenus making the simplest thing confusing. Yesterday after about 3 hours of attempt, I managed to have my father joining a session. This took just 3 hours to share a screen, and will take a few more to allow to share control. We gave up eventually after I had to expel my father from the session after he looked for 15 minutes for the button to stop sharing. Extremely frustrating experience. This is completely overcomplicated, we need a new tool to simply be able to share desktop with remote session. Currently creating a meeting involves launching the app, click on 'start meeting' then on the new pop up window login, then on the third pop up window click 'start meeting'.. How many more steps will you add to this? I can t wait for the next update where most likely more useless option will be added to clutter the interface(s).\nLike Zoom.",

      "As an independent training provider over the last few months I have been using MS Teams, Zoho Showtime and Zoom for training. One corporate client insisted that we had to use Cisco Webex.  The whole this was a shambles.\n\nFirstly, the website doesn't make clear that 'Meetings' and 'Training' are two completely different products.  No where does it explain the features, or the cost difference.  Hence I ended up with the wrong product.  After speaking to the inappropriately named 'Customer Success Team' I was told this couldn't simply be converted.  I had to wait 2-weeks to have a sales call, by which time I'd missed a deadline.\n\nOnce I had access to Webex Training I realised the product is AWFUL.  By far the worst online platform I have used.  So I decided to cancel the Training subscription and if the client needed me to use Webex use the much cheaper 'Meetings' product.\n\nIn the sales call I was CATEGORICALLY told that this was a rolling monthly contract that could be cancelled at any point.  I specifically asked this question because I knew I would only need it for the duration on the one client contract. \n\nOn 12 July I requested the cancellation of the contract.  It wasn't actioned.\n\nTwo weeks later I got an stream of emails asking me to confirm I wanted the account cancelled. Which I replied to.  Since, I'd requested it and confirmed it, I foolishly assumed that it had been done.\n\nThen I get an invoice for the account.  So I phoned them.  A helpful guy, told me that the cancellation came after monthly date so I would have to pay for the second month but that he would action the cancellation immediately.   On the 17 August I got an emailing confirming the cancellation. \n\nIn the meantime I got a sales call following up on my original inquiry in June (for a product I'd taken out, hated and was trying to cancel)!\n\nA month later, another email - in which my name was wrong and it was so full of syntax errors that it was hard to read.  \n\nThis time I was told that I couldn't cancel my account because it was a one-year subscription.  This was the first time this had been mentioned and certainly NOT what I was told in the sales call.   \n\nI replied clearly laying out my case and attaching evidence that I'd been told the account had been cancelled.   Again, I was told (25 August) that a request to cancel with immediate effect have been sent to the cancellation team.  I got no further details until today 3 September, when I receive yet another bill.\n\nI phoned again and was told again that I was on a one year subscription - which I wasn't.  They have again promised to look into it but I'm not holding my breathe.\n\nIf you like confusing, clunky and counter-intuitive software and have plenty of spare time to waste dealing with the inefficient and ineffective customer services department at Cisco.  Then Webex is the product for you.\n\nIf on the other hand you want a smooth product and responsive customer service, try Zoho or Microsoft!",

      "I should have known how bad they would be from my first attempt to call Webex to join their Event Center.\nIt's impossible to get anyone on the phone, even a sales person when you're tying to sign-up.\nAudio completely failed when attempting to play a recording to webinar attendees. Tech support were slow to investigate, resulting in the cancellation of our events. When a response finally came a week later, and too late for our event, it was clear that they had completely failed to understand what the problem was.\nThe account was obviously then cancelled. When the invoice was received there were hundreds of pounds of charges for attendees calling into the broken event. These charges had not been mentioned by the sales person.",
