      'HR named Akshit and a scam girl Shirleywho is a designer but boasts to be a Product Manager have been accused and caught of scamming multiple candidates by pleading them, spamming them from different numbers and pressurising them to do free and unpaid project work of their talent deprived team on the name of assignments/assessments of fake job postings on Linkedin\n\nThey can even eat my shhhh for getting me hired and the assignment done, however, I got to know their fraudulent behaviour from communities\n\nThe pro LGBT like guy named Akshit calls from different numbers and says " Please assignment dedo , meri laaj rakhlo , I will advocate your profile "shirley shortlisted you, she likes you and bla blah, on denial he calls from different numbers, also when I told him I am inclined towards different roles he said he doesnt want to say scammer shirley about this, as she is after my profile\n\nAlso the app isnt GDPR compliant they have been misusing the data of their clients and also the customer base\n\nIt seemed fishy from the starting , however the leadership should keep checks on the execution of such frauds',
