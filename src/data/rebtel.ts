Then tried wifi and 3/4G options too.\n\nThe results were the same: a prerecorded message in Russia tells me some bullshit. A minute is used, the call does not reach my friend.\n\nAmazing such scams could work on Apple store.",

Situation I am travelling in France living in Singapore hence having a Singapore provider. This all started 11th April today I got my phone bill and this freaking provider called a Singapore number to then connect, means I have now 800 SGD roaming charges!!! This is fraudulent! I have all proof!!! \nUpdate 15th evening: I have provided the evidence as requested and total amount relevant to the fraudulent app are 500SGD at the moment, I do expect further costs as my billing ended 11th April and only today I saw the desaster. Anyhow I will share here on TrustPilot how the company is taking action.",

Never ever going to use it again. There are far better companies out there. I will suggest peoples not to use it again.",

    title: "If you enjoy apps designed like a drunken scavenger hunt, Rebtel is for you.",
    content: "The user interface is horrifically unintuitive — basic features like dialing a number are hidden behind a maze of badly labelled menus. After paying for a subscription, you have to guess how to actually make a call. There is no clear dialpad, no helpful prompts, and no logical flow.\n\nAccessibility? Forget it. It's like they designed this thing blindfolded.\nI spent more time trying to find the call button than actually making calls.\n\"User-friendly\" is obviously not a concept anyone at Rebtel has heard of. The irony is, I am a UX expert, and if anyone in my team ever produced such a shit interface, they would be fired.\n\nTo top it off, their so-called \"free trial\" still requires you to pay if you want to call any real numbers. Classic bait-and-switch tactic buried deep in their terms.\nNot impressed!",

I then contacted customer support, and they informed me that, due to internal policy, my number is excluded from registering with Rebtel and that I should use a different number. This explanation seems vague and unreasonable. I shouldn’t have to get a new phone number simply because they have an issue with my current one.\n\nI bought a new number to try and use their service, following customer service’s suggestion that I register with a different number due to \"internal policy.\" However, after registering the new number, it was also immediately blocked, and my account was locked. I’m left without any clear reasoning and feel like I’ve wasted both my time and money.\n\nI read through their policies regarding excluded countries, and my country is not on their list. Additionally, their other usage policies do not refer to anything that could apply to me.\n\nAs a result, I am being excluded from their service for no clear reason, and they haven’t provided a detailed explanation. \"Internal policy\" could mean anything. I would like to know why my number was excluded from registration, as I believe a clear explanation would help resolve this matter.",
