      "I am writing this to express my deep dissatisfaction with a recent customer support experience, as well as ongoing critical service issues with RingCentral.\n\nWe experienced a major disruption where we were unable to receive incoming calls, a core function essential to our business operations. I reached out to RingCentral support and was connected with a representative whose conduct was highly unprofessional. The agent appeared disengaged, yawning audibly and making odd noises during the call, possibly under the impression he was muted.\n\nUnfortunately, he was unable to provide a helpful solution. He advised that I log out and back into the system, but after doing so, I was unable to log back in and became completely locked out. The only access I had was through a browser session that remained active.\n\nThe representative attempted to send me a login code via email, but due to delays in the RingCentral system, the code did not arrive in time (it was consistently delayed by over five minutes, while the login code times out after 120 seconds). When I suggested alternative solutions or escalation to another support agent, he abruptly ended the call without any further communication. Notably, no call-back information was taken, nor was there any follow-up attempt from your team.\n\nI called back and was connected with another representative named John, who was more competent and able to help me find a temporary workaround. However, the underlying issue remains unresolved if I revert to our original workflow.\n\nTo add to the frustration, there appears to be no formal escalation path, and no platform to publicly share feedback such as Google Reviews. I am left with no other option but to voice my experience here, in hopes that it reaches someone within RingCentral who takes customer service and platform reliability seriously.\n\nThis level of service is simply unacceptable for a business-critical platform. I am now actively seeking alternatives to RingCentral and anticipate transitioning our business communications to another provider very soon.\n\nI don't know the exact date it happened, but am sure RingCentral can find it in their logs - it was late March I believe.",

We have struggled with them for over 4 years, but it was so tough to switch everyone in our company to another carrier, that we muddled along with them until it came time to have to work on getting our company set up with the new rules to enroll in texting campaigns. We called literally over 20 times to try to get help on this. They kept giving us really vague things, but never helped us to successfully get our text message campaigns through. Then they took away our ability to text message our clients. Instead of trying to help us, they tried to sell us more products. I went to a different provider and told them what the issue was. They literally helped us with our text campaign and within 24 hours we had our text campaign approved. So we moved all of our numbers over to the new provider, and let Ring Central know. They proceeded to tell me that they will charge me for THE FULL YEAR since my contract just renewed with them, despite them not being able to help us for over a year. Shame on them.",

      "I have been a RingCentral customer for over a decade.  Generally, the phone system has been reliable and delivered what we needed in terms of call routing and management of incoming calls.  The issue with RingCentral has been the poor customer service.  Over the years, I have requested that they reach out to me via email as my primary form of communication.  They refuse to do so and leave dozens of voice mails on my cell phone for simple items, that I don't have the time for phone calls for, that can easily be addressed in a simple email.\n\nSince then, the new SMS requirements have become a point of contention with RingCentral.  They have a rejection committee that charges you for each submission to reject every attempt to get SMS approval.  We have been attempting to get this resolved for nearly 8 months now and continue to get the same generalized rejection responses.  In the meantime, we have already had 2 other 3rd party SMS communication systems approved.  Mind you, they have the same SMS regulatory requirements.\n\nMy only reason for not already changing providers is the time commitment and difficulty in changing phone providers when it is a critical business operation.  I am reaching the point where that will be less of a hurdle because working with RingCentral is the bigger hurdle.  If you aren't a current RingCentral customer, I recommend you shop elsewhere for a provider.",

      "DO NOT SIGN ANY AGREEMENT - CONTRACT IS NOT CLEAR ON THE LENGTH OF TIME YOU MUST PAY DESPITE CANCELLATION REQUEST. On or around October 26th, a transactional sale was performed by me with a RingCentral sales representative. On a recorded line the representative did not highlight and mention in the disclosures any fees for early termination. Upon cancellation, I find there is a contractual agreement to pay for 12 months and the $408 I have paid thus far will not be allowed to complete said agreement. I am halfway through the contract and I would like the original sales call record to be pulled for me and an attorney to review for misconduct. The electronic signature process was done with a representative over the phone but no disclosures were completed and specifically, the termination and fees of the contract were not highlighted and reviewed on the sales call. Additionally, RingCentral violates conduct under the FTC by not providing a clickable cancellation button that performs the act of cancellation. To cancel, I had to wait 45 minutes on hold to speak with an aggressive and pretentious representative who without warning disconnected the call without answering my questions. The RingCentral rep I spoke to on 4/4/2025 would not give me a name or employee id because she knew her attitude was being recorded and refused to be identified by hanging up. These are the acts RingCentral has violated just to name a few:\n\nCalifornia's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA):\nCalifornia's CLRA requires businesses to disclose all costs and fees upfront and in their ads, including potential termination fee\n\nFTC's Click-to-Cancel Rule:\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has implemented a \"click-to-cancel\" rule, requiring businesses to make it easy for consumers to cancel subscriptions, and this includes clearly disclosing cancellation terms and fees. The Admin Portal does not allow you to click-to-cancel. There is a button but it forces you to call and does not show any terms or conditions and the cancellation button is non-clickable. \n\nFTC Negative Option\n",

The support experience has been one of the worst I’ve encountered in my life.\n\nThe support team appears completely untrained. They don’t know how to resolve issues, and multiple times they simply hung up on me. Calls last a minimum of 45 minutes, and even after all that time, you get nowhere. No supervisors are ever available, and requests to escalate are ignored or delayed until the call drops.\n\nTo make matters worse, they are closing tickets without even responding. Then, when I follow up, they refer me back to those same closed tickets—it's a complete disaster and beyond frustrating.\n\nIt feels like the company has outsourced support without any quality control. The whole experience is unprofessional, disorganized, and unacceptable. It’s shocking that a company would allow this level of service and continue to operate this way.\n\nI cannot recommend this service to anyone. It’s been 7 days of absolute nightmare, and I still have no answers or resolution.\n\nThey are definitely not available 24/7 as claimed. It's misleading, being 24/7 should mean providing real help and solutions, not just ignoring chats and calls.",

      "I have been a RingCentral customer for over a decade.  Generally, the phone system has been reliable and delivered what we needed in terms of call routing and management of incoming calls.  The issue with RingCentral has been the poor customer service.  Over the years, I have requested that they reach out to me via email as my primary form of communication.  They refuse to do so and leave dozens of voice mails on my cell phone for simple items, that I don't have the time for phone calls for, that can easily be addressed in a simple email.\n\nSince then, the new SMS requirements have become a point of contention with RingCentral.  They have a rejection committee that charges you for each submission to reject every attempt to get SMS approval.  We have been attempting to get this resolved for nearly 8 months now and continue to get the same generalized rejection responses.  In the meantime, we have already had 2 other 3rd party SMS communication systems approved.  Mind you, they have the same SMS regulatory requirements.\n\nMy only reason for not already changing providers is the time commitment and difficulty in changing phone providers when it is a critical business operation.  I am reaching the point where that will be less of a hurdle because working with RingCentral is the bigger hurdle.  If you aren't a current RingCentral customer, I recommend you shop elsewhere for a provider.",

They literally helped us with our text campaign and within 24 hours we had our text campaign approved. So we moved all of our numbers over to the new provider, and let Ring Central know.

      "I am writing this to express my deep dissatisfaction with a recent customer support experience, as well as ongoing critical service issues with RingCentral.\n\nWe experienced a major disruption where we were unable to receive incoming calls, a core function essential to our business operations. I reached out to RingCentral support and was connected with a representative whose conduct was highly unprofessional. The agent appeared disengaged, yawning audibly and making odd noises during the call, possibly under the impression he was muted.\n\nUnfortunately, he was unable to provide a helpful solution. He advised that I log out and back into the system, but after doing so, I was unable to log back in and became completely locked out. The only access I had was through a browser session that remained active.\n\nThe representative attempted to send me a login code via email, but due to delays in the RingCentral system, the code did not arrive in time (it was consistently delayed by over five minutes, while the login code times out after 120 seconds). When I suggested alternative solutions or escalation to another support agent, he abruptly ended the call without any further communication. Notably, no call-back information was taken, nor was there any follow-up attempt from your team.\n\nI called back and was connected with another representative named John, who was more competent and able to help me find a temporary workaround. However, the underlying issue remains unresolved if I revert to our original workflow.\n\nTo add to the frustration, there appears to be no formal escalation path, and no platform to publicly share feedback such as Google Reviews. I am left with no other option but to voice my experience here, in hopes that it reaches someone within RingCentral who takes customer service and platform reliability seriously.\n\nThis level of service is simply unacceptable for a business-critical platform. I am now actively seeking alternatives to RingCentral and anticipate transitioning our business communications to another provider very soon.\n\nI don't know the exact date it happened, but am sure RingCentral can find it in their logs - it was late March I believe.",

      "DO NOT SIGN ANY AGREEMENT - CONTRACT IS NOT CLEAR ON THE LENGTH OF TIME YOU MUST PAY DESPITE CANCELLATION REQUEST. On or around October 26th, a transactional sale was performed by me with a RingCentral sales representative. On a recorded line the representative did not highlight and mention in the disclosures any fees for early termination. Upon cancellation, I find there is a contractual agreement to pay for 12 months and the $408 I have paid thus far will not be allowed to complete said agreement. I am halfway through the contract and I would like the original sales call record to be pulled for me and an attorney to review for misconduct. The electronic signature process was done with a representative over the phone but no disclosures were completed and specifically, the termination and fees of the contract were not highlighted and reviewed on the sales call. Additionally, RingCentral violates conduct under the FTC by not providing a clickable cancellation button that performs the act of cancellation. To cancel, I had to wait 45 minutes on hold to speak with an aggressive and pretentious representative who without warning disconnected the call without answering my questions. The RingCentral rep I spoke to on 4/4/2025 would not give me a name or employee id because she knew her attitude was being recorded and refused to be identified by hanging up. These are the acts RingCentral has violated just to name a few:\n\nCalifornia's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA):\nCalifornia's CLRA requires businesses to disclose all costs and fees upfront and in their ads, including potential termination fee\n\nFTC's Click-to-Cancel Rule:\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has implemented a \"click-to-cancel\" rule, requiring businesses to make it easy for consumers to cancel subscriptions, and this includes clearly disclosing cancellation terms and fees. The Admin Portal does not allow you to click-to-cancel. There is a button but it forces you to call and does not show any terms or conditions and the cancellation button is non-clickable. \n\nFTC Negative Option\n",

      "I recently signed up for a service involving 15 numbers, and it's been over 7 days without a completed integration. The support experience has been one of the worst I’ve encountered in my life.\n\nThe support team appears completely untrained. They don’t know how to resolve issues, and multiple times they simply hung up on me. Calls last a minimum of 45 minutes, and even after all that time, you get nowhere. No supervisors are ever available, and requests to escalate are ignored or delayed until the call drops.\n\nTo make matters worse, they are closing tickets without even responding. Then, when I follow up, they refer me back to those same closed tickets—it's a complete disaster and beyond frustrating.\n\nIt feels like the company has outsourced support without any quality control. The whole experience is unprofessional, disorganized, and unacceptable. It’s shocking that a company would allow this level of service and continue to operate this way.\n\nI cannot recommend this service to anyone. It’s been 7 days of absolute nightmare, and I still have no answers or resolution.\n\nThey are definitely not available 24/7 as claimed. It's misleading, being 24/7 should mean providing real help and solutions, not just ignoring chats and calls.",
