    title: "Dear Concerned Authority,",
    content: "I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the quality of service provided by the IMO Customer Care Feedback Center. Whenever I submit an issue or report, the responses I receive are often irrelevant, unhelpful, and completely unrelated to the concerns I raised.\n\nThe answers provided by your team are highly disappointing, and as a user, I am far from satisfied with their service. To highlight this, I frequently rate their responses as \"Not Satisfied\" with a single star, hoping it would bring the matter to your attention. Unfortunately, even after repeated poor evaluations, there has been no improvement in the quality of responses or the service provided.\n\nSuch inadequate and unsatisfactory service is disheartening and erodes user trust in IMO. I strongly urge you to take this issue seriously and implement measures to improve the efficiency and relevance of the support team’s responses. Proper training for the concerned officials to address user concerns effectively is crucial in this regard.\n\nI hope this matter will be addressed promptly, ensuring a better customer service experience for all users.\n\nSincerely,\nBangladesh imo User",

    content: "Good quality calls (a huge improvement over the past 5+ years), but the adverts following a call are very intrusive. They cover the whole page and it's impossible to go a step back even after watching the ad. The app needs to be closed and opened again for another call.\n\nAlso, if you make a non-video call and then you decide you want to show something on camera, it's impossible to just open the camera during that call. You have to hang up and make another video call. If Viber, WhatsApp, Skype, Meet and many other apps allow this, why can't Imo?  Either that, or remove the option for calls and only have video calls (where there is an option to turn the camera on and off as needed).",
