      "I hoped that I can start using Viber instead of Skype. However, after spending 3 days trying to activate the Viber account I still could not resolve the issues. Viver's customer support is useless. I am stuck a Viber bot hell. Viber bot presented me with a captcha, which a solved. The bot informed me that the Captcha test was successfully passed and that my account will be unblocked in one hour. Several hours later the bot informed me that I failed passing the Captcha test. It does not give me an opportunity to retake it. The Viber customer support does not respond.",
