    content: "Our deep seated frustration stems from a cavalier attitude toward customer satisfaction and management inaccessibility. Every month we have incremental charges from calls to Puerto Rico (they can't suppress PR calls according to the information we received(, to taxes, extra lines, etc. It's extremely difficult to get any charges reversed. We also had a problem with our renewal. We did not receive prior notification and paid for more users and lines than needed. When we were billed for the renewal, we immediately contacted  multiple people, multiple departments, multiple times asking if we could revise the renewal. The answer was essentially, \"Read the fine print\", as were sent copies of their boilerplate contract terms. Of course WE NEVER RECEIVED THE RENEWAL NOTIFICATION, SO WE COULDN'T READ THE FINE PRINT!\n\nSupport was not helpful in providing us access to anyone who could help us. We asked to speak with a manager (multiple times) but they never responded. We're not talking about a lot of money here, less than $1,000 dollars. We never received a credit or refund, but we did receive a  plethora of negativity and a boatload of attitude. \n\nWe're expecting to move on to a completive solution in the near future, and letting the community know about negative experiences with this organization.",

    content: "Overall my experience with Aircall has been very negative. Initially I was switching over from RingCentral simply for the feature that allows me to have a chrome-extension in order to easily call/text customers via our shopify dashboard. In the process I had a hard time porting over the phone numbers. It was usually very difficult to get basic tasks like the phone number to work, and reaching customer service help was tough. Not to mention the steep price tag. I also managed to pay for \"AI convo summaries\" which I never was able to work with. I then realized that ring central offers exactly what I was hoping for all along and quickly switched back. Now I'm having an incredibly hard time cancelling. When I was signing up, the sales rep promised that I can cancel anytime and when I asked for that in writing he declined but said he would be able to cancel on my behalf if ever needed. I was directly lied to and manipulated when signing up, that should have been a warning to begin with. Avoid this company at all costs as there are much better options out there for much cheaper (Ring Central). I am writing this review because it is likely the ony way management will even look into my case and give me some sort of reply. ",

    content: "Completely incompetent and terrible software.  We ported our business numbers over to this company as they are enabled for both MMS and SMS messaging. However in order for our staff to be able to answer each others phone calls we had to put everyone in a \"Team\" which meant that we can all see each other's text messages and would get a notification each time anyone in the Team would get one. Then it soon became apparent that the Aircall app cannot accept short-code messages.  So anytime we received a MFA code for Docusign or from some other supplier/provider portal, the message wouldn't come through and we would have to call their helpdesk, spend 15 minutes on the phone waiting for them to get someone from the right team and then reissue the MFA code so that we could proceed with our work. Completely garbage software.\n\nSo, we ported our mobile numbers to another provider and put in the request for the 1800 number. I emailed the person we had been dealing with at Aircall to tell them we had requested to port the 1800 number but it would take a week or so and what are the next steps to cancel the account.  No reply. At all. Next thing we know - we have an overdue notice even though our payment details are saved in the dashboard and our 1800 number is not working. I contact their support - the person had CANCELLED the account. Without telling us, without waiting for payment to go through and without waiting for the port to happen. The support person is now trying to tell me that we have to sign a NEW AGREEMENT in order to reactivate the account. \n\nDo not waste your time with this company.",

The challenge was considerable: we had to migrate over 40 users, set up new phone numbers, and implement the system in a fraction of the time we would have ideally had.\n\nFortunately, Aircall stepped in and made the entire transition process as smooth as possible. From the very beginning, the Aircall team provided their support. They offered clear and practical advice that helped us make the best decision quickly. Their guidance throughout the selection process made the decision much easier.\n\nDuring the implementation phase, we were supported by a competent and professional onboarding manager. The Aircall team ensured that the transition was seamless, managing the setup of new numbers and configurations while minimizing disruptions to our operations. Their customer-centric approach and attention to detail were evident at every stage, ensuring we could hit the ground running.\n\nIn summary, Aircall made the switch to a new provider much less stressful than it could have been.
