      'On the good side , responses were very quick although not very helpful. Comparing with Skype , they only have one bank account and its in USD even though the company is Estonian. Skype can accept payments in all major currencies , and i was expecting the same from such a competitor. Even now more alarming as the Dollar is being disowned in so many financial arenas. Biggest issue is to pay these in USD means commission payments to banks and exchange rates varying dramatically, even more so currently. A "buyer beware" notification in this respect for anyone not using USD as their standard currency should be flagged.',
