      "I cancelled the service because I was switching to a different company to be able to use new features for my business they are offering.  \nCalled the end of November 2024 to cancel the service when my new company notified me my number had been ported and after spending a long time on hold I was told everyone I need to talk to had left the office. I called back on December 2, 2024 to again cancel the service. I was put on hold, cut off or dropped call on transfer. Called back was put on hold. Recording said my wait time was 6 minutes however it was 36 minutes. After not being able to use the reference number the guy gave me in November and not being able to use my phone number to find my account the lady finally found my account and then insisted my number had not been ported.  I was put on hold (Again) so she could check to see if the number had been ported. She finally returned and said yes it had been ported. I stated I wanted to cancel the account and asked for a refund of the last 4 month of the yearly subscription.  The  yearly started on 3/20/2024 for $475.80 and was set to renew the end of February 25.  She then informed me I would not get the refund for December, January, February, and March because they do not give refunds. After spending  2+ hrs. on the phone just to find out I am being ripped off for the money I paid in good faith does not set well with me and I will never recommend Phone.com to anyone.  I will not give Phone.com a good review.  EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER CARE",

      ' encountered a significant discrepancy in pricing while attempting to sign up for this service. Initially, the price was displayed as $27 per user during the account creation process. However, upon reaching the checkout stage, the total unexpectedly jumped to $82 per user after taxes and additional charges.\n\nThis lack of transparency in pricing feels misleading and unprofessional. Potential users should exercise caution when considering this service. I would recommend looking into alternative options that are more upfront and clear about their pricing."',

In the past, I called support 2 years ago and was great. Today, I talked to support, no clue about phone, could not tell what was wrong, could see my MAC address, but could not send config file.  Now, I have to look for new provider. Anyone have Ideas.  If phone.com has a solution I will stay (if you are reading this).  Going to keep till end of month have app on cell phone.  \nHope this helps.",

      "I've been using Phone.com for the last 3+ years. We recently increased our # of phones/lines from 3 to 7. In doing so, Phone.com did not program them properly and then there was an issue with their network which prevented us from being able to set them up. We spent countless hours on the phone with Phone.com's support to no avail. They seemed clueless. Finally we hired an IT company to help us, who successfully got them working. We asked Phone.com for reimbursement on this invoice and they refused because we should have followed their support team's instructions .... which was to reset the internet equipment over and over again until we became tired of sitting on the phone with them. Phone.com is not worth the expense, hassle or poor excuse of a support team. ",
