I didn’t get it quite right the first time, but Edward stepped in with clear, step-by-step guidance that made the entire process smooth and stress-free. He was incredibly patient, detailed, and made sure everything was set up correctly—thank you, Edward, for going above and beyond!",

Every question or issue I brought up was addressed quickly and efficiently by their support team. It’s rare to find a company that takes customer feedback seriously and resolves concerns in real time.\n\nThe platform itself is intuitive and well-designed, making the transition from my previous setup incredibly smooth. It’s clear OpenPhone is built with real users in mind. So far, everything just works—and if something doesn’t, I know their team is on it fast.\n\nHighly recommend OpenPhone to any business looking for a reliable and modern communication solution backed by a solid team.",

    content: "Although the features at the price point beats most of the VoIP service providers in the market. The only pain point we noticed in our more than 3 years of using OpenPhone is that they do not have any customer support over phone. You have to submit a ticket each time you face any issue and at times one wouldn’t be able to explain the issue details as accurately as done over a phone call interacting with a live person. Nonetheless we started of with 2 lines and now hold 15 lines and are satisfied with the services. Kudos to the OpenPhone team.",

    title: "Honest Review: I signed up 2 months ago.",
    content: "Honest Review: I signed up 2 months ago. I purchased their three numbers and paid for the entire year upfront, almost $1K, and this was the biggest mistake I ever made. I thought they were a growing company so they will be better, but NO they are worst.\n\nFirst of all, their verification method is too long; like they are issuing VISAs!! idiots. BTW I passed all the verifications; it took almost a month. Then I purchased 3 numbers and paid for yearly upfront. Then the real game started; they disabled my account first time in February 2025 with the reason that they saw so many calls from our team side, whereas our team was making 5-10 calls a day, which was our customers. So their system can't even handle such low volume. Their team replied ohh that it was due to the system's mistake or trigger, so we reinstated your account. Then again, after 10 days, their system again disabled with the same reasoning. This was unexpected because their system was inefficient, which I found out in the meanwhile. So then I just disabled outbound calls, domestic and international, just to see what would happen. Then and now, yesterday, their system again disabled the account. It's hilarious and now mentally disturbing. \nAnd on email, their is the same reason so I am done now the most panic part is that they are putting a voice IVR ON YOUR PHONE numbers automatically that this account is Disabled so if your customers dialing your numbers in the meanwhile so they get to know this which is too much scary part. I came, I spent, and I learned, so if you want to learn something from someone's experiences, then it's better to NOT sign up with OpenPhone. Their interface looks better, but their service and support are worst and not friendly. All in all, after sale service is ZERO. ",
