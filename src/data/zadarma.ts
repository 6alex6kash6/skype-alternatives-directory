A lot of functionality is gone, using a privacy VPN for security doesn't work so they have made moves to access people's data more. Very disturbing. I'm going back to Skype probably except that's gone now.  \n\nI took huge levels of investment capital out of the Country they are based in as a recourse. The information they used to change their systems seems stolen and breached privacy laws. I sent the Capital further East on the Eur-Asian continent. ",

      "I’ve been using Zadarma for over six months without any major issues, and my account was fully verified. I had even uploaded all the necessary documents during the initial registration process, which were accepted at the time. However, just recently, I was suddenly locked out of my account with no warning, no email, and no prior notice.\n\nNaturally, I contacted their live support, expecting at least some clarity. Instead, I was told they had opened a support ticket and I had to wait—no reason was given, no information shared. The support staff were vague and completely unhelpful.\n\nA full day passed without any response, so I followed up. That’s when I was informed that my account had been blocked because they “didn't like” the document I had previously submitted—the same document they accepted months ago. When I offered to provide updated documentation or go through another verification process, they flat-out refused. Their exact advice was to \"change services\".\n\nWhat’s even more outrageous is that they refused to explain what was wrong with the document. No specifics, no chance to fix the issue, just a vague and dismissive explanation. I asked multiple times for clarification, but all I got was the same generic line: “We don’t accept your document.” That’s it. \nAfter a day of back and forth emails, they asked scanned documents, I've uploaded my drivers license and passport, both scanned versions. But still answered the same. It is ridiculous. Wouldn't recomend their services even to anyone. \nThis experience has completely destroyed any trust I had in their platform. There’s zero accountability and zero transparency, and their customer support is either poorly trained or just doesn’t care. Avoid this service if you value consistency, professionalism, or your time.\nTicket №806425 which ",

      "Zadarma.com is a complete scam. They collect your payment as soon as you sign up—before you can even access or use the service. After paying, you're immediately forced into a broken and frustrating verification process that leads nowhere.\n\nI submitted my documents, including my business registration, but their system keeps looping me back to take a passport photo and a selfie again. There are no clear instructions, no confirmation, and absolutely no access to the service I paid for.\n\nThe pricing may seem attractive, but it's a catch—they're more focused on collecting your personal information than actually providing the service. It feels like they’re intentionally stalling while holding on to your money.\n\nTheir customer support is completely useless. I opened a support ticket, and all I received were copy-paste replies with no real help or resolution.\n\nAfter reading more reviews online, it’s clear I’m not the only one. Many others are calling them out for fraud, data harvesting, and unethical practices.\n\nThis website and its practices must be reported to the FBI. I will also be making a video to share my experience and warn others not to fall into the same trap.\n\nAvoid Zadarma.com at all costs. This is not a trustworthy company.",
