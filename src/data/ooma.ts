      "I exclusively use the phone app on my iPhone to use the service. It is virtually impossible to create a separate address book for the business number. You can only give the service access to your entire phone personal address book. Since I don't want or need to build an address book from my personal list, this is useless. It requires you to look up a number each time you want to place a call to a business contact. The service does not identify spam calls. Other than a modest fee for the service, I would recommend you look elsewhere for a business phone service.",

I immediately canceled, but they refused, and after 24 hours, said that oops, you didn't cancel within 24 hours. In PA, we are allowed to cancel in 3 days! I think this is how they stay in business, by charging  your credit card. DO NOT EVER GIVE OOMA YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER. Better yet, just don't call them at all. Use Grasshopper instead.",

The third time I called, I called to cancel my account they hung up on me again. I had to threaten for my legal team to reach out to them before they hung up again. Finally they talked to me. When I was telling the lady on the phone what was going on and that I just wanted to cancel my account she kept me on the phone for another 45 mins tryin to tell me why I shouldn't cancel my account, not listening to anything I was saying. STAY AWAY FROM THEM! I have no idea how they were the number 1 choice on google. ",

I called in and they said that it say in the contract that you have 60 days to opt out of the premier package. So I was charged for the device, 6 months of the regular use and then however many months of the premier package for something I never once got to use. I called in and complained and they refunded me 2 months of the $10 extra.  I had been trying to get my mom the same ooma telo and I'm so grateful that I didn't.  My fault was trying to find the actual cord I needed to plug it into a hardwired phone instead of canceling immediately.  The kicker is at the end of the phone call I was asked if I was satisfied with the service she gave me. Obviously I said no!",

      "I wish I had checked here first before ordering OOMA. Other sites I saw highly recommended it. Uuugghhh!!\nI've had Vonage for YEARS paying a minimal charge and available to call international without ever having any problem except the order of plugging in my service between it, my phone, my router and computer. The order was important and being elderly, I couldn't never remember. I then switched to Xfinity/Comcast, which....HATE the company, their constant inconsistent billing, inability to reach someone to help you and bills tripling over night because of a rate change from a plan you didn't know was ending. They don't let you know...so they can make the money when it changes, since you won't know until a later time when you get a high bill!!! So, I thought I had chosen a new good basic voip plan with OOMA...only needed the basic service as backup since it is not the primary phone. They lied to me telling me they were 100% customer service in the USA, in California. Today, I learned that was a lie because I spent OVER 2 hours with someone in Philippines with LOTS of problems!! They also said the phone base would come in 3-5 days. Lied again. It took 10 days!! I was upset because I'm still paying the horribly high bill with Xfinity, because I want to keep my phone number, and can't cancel my internet and phone until the new system is set up. They also said it was very simple to set up. LIE !!!  I just wasted my entire afternoon fighting with this system...between my cell phone and laptop, trying to get it set-up. It didn't like the password, wouldn't acknowledge the change...finally called customer service and that call lasted over 2 hours! Just one issue after another !! It could not verify that porting my phone number actually worked...so she did it also on her end, put then she could not send me anything to know for sure that it went through. ONLY THEN, did I learn it may take up to 2 weeks to port my phone number (transfer it from Xfinity to OOMA) which I was NEVER told, and would not have bought the service had I known. This was never the case when I used Vonage. I am so angry, I am about to have a heart attack!! So all in all, OOMA charged me for the base unit, I waited almost 10 days to receive it, then I spent all afternoon fighting trying to get it set up, trying a jillion passwords that it kept rejecting, then on customer service for 2+ hours alone, and then to find out that my regular home phone number will not be ported and active for possibly 2 weeks more, PLUS, Xfinity will charge me $40.00 to transfer my number! In the meantime, I will be charge roughly $70-80 while waiting for all of this to happen, because I can't cancel my Xfinity until the phone number transfers or I risk loosing the phone number I have had for 38 years!!!!!  TECHNOLOGY SUCKS!! and I hate outsourced customer service who sound nice on the line, but give fake name and have no accountability for their lies or inability to help!!! Life was much easier when things were simplier!!! Had I known all of this before, I would have gone back to Vonage!",

I've made FIVE calls over a span of three weeks, each lasting over 42 minutes, explaining the same issues with dropped calls and the severe impact it's having on my business. After all that time, they sent me a replacement phone, which was even worse than the first one!\n\nThe customer service reps are polite, but it feels like they have a script they follow, repeatedly asking me to check my Wi-Fi, reboot the phone, and go through the same troubleshooting steps every single time. It's incredibly frustrating and exhausting, and I'm no closer to having a functional phone. My problem is still unresolved, and I'm losing business because of it. Overall, terrible service and zero resolution. I'm extremely disappointed.",
