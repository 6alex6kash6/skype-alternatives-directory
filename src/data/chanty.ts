The simplicity of the interface, fast performance, and ease of use have made this service my favorite tool for team collaboration.\n\nI especially appreciate the ability to organize tasks directly in chats — it saves so much time. Another highlight is the seamless integration with other services like Google Drive and Trello, which makes the workflow even more efficient.\n\nI highly recommend Chanty to anyone looking to simplify team workflows and focus on achieving results. It's simply a perfect service!",

    content: "I've been using Chanty since before the public release and have been impressed.  I was a frustrated Slack user who also used Basecamp for a little while.  Both systems were way too expensive and also too busy/heavy for our small team.  When Slack started deleting older threads because we'd reached our maximum storage space, that was the last straw.  We needed a simple, conversational platform to consolidate conversations that were happening across email and too many different kinds of messaging apps.  We also don't have a lot of wiggle room in our budget.  Chanty fit the bill.  The interface is easy to use, and updates/upgrades have come steadily since the public release.  Any time I've had a question or problem, the support staff has been quick and friendly in their reply - and they've solved the problem every time!  I'd definitely recommend giving Chanty a try!",
