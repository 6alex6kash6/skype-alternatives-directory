      "8x8 was a good VOIP provider for my solo work but ultimately became useless when they cut access to SMS messaging - inbound and outbound with known clients in my contact list.  The feature set is stale, I asked if they planned to introduce transcripts to call recordings with AI summaries and was told no.  Really?\n\nThe end of our relationship was like a contested divorce requiring me to jump through pages of instructions on how to cancel the service.  \n\nAt the end of the day, their account managers were always helpful and plowed through to have simple requests handled professionally.  Their support team is not up to the tasks they've been assigned and are at fault for the reputation they've witnessed going under.  ",

My business was stuck with them for 4 years because my staff didn't know better and sign up with them.  When I research about them I wanted to cancel, and even so they make cancellation process extremely difficult and heavy fees so you cannot cancel with them.  I need to gather all their customers and file a law suite case against them.  ",

      "Stay away from this company. We agreed to a 30-day risk free trial to test out their VoIP system, and they sent us phones. We received no in-person or direct help on how to set up the system. Unless you have a tech person ready to DIY their system, it will be incredibly difficult to set-up. Additionally, we realized our monthly charges were outrageous, and not at all cost-effective. You essentially 'rent' out their phones, which after a year or so means you pay way more than the retail price of the actual phones.\nWe ended up cancelling within the 30-day period once we realized how predatory and sketchy this company was. Cancelling was also a long-winded process, which you must be very meticulous about to avoid extra fees. We mailed the phones back (only one of which we even took out of the box), and are currently fighting to get our money back despite being told we would be refunded.\nThis company is predatory, scammy, and not reliable. Would not recommend. ",

I’ve submitted multiple customer service requests, yet no one reaches out—just to find out they close the tickets without resolving anything. Really frustrating and unprofessional.
