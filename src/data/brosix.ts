    content: "I had been searching and testing multiple chat applications for work purposes and found Brosix to be outstanding above all. An outstanding feature was being able to adjust the position and timeframe of alert notifications, which ensures in a busy workplace no messages are left unread. The option to integrate a live chat into websites I found very appealing also. The team at Brosix are very responsive when seeking help and all around I highly recommend it.",
